# Benchmark script:
#  - developed for benchmarking ingress qdisc path
#
# Script for injecting packets into RX path of the stack with pktgen
# "xmit_mode netif_receive".  With an invalid dst_mac this will only
# measure the ingress code path as packets gets dropped in ip_rcv().
#
# This script don't really need any hardware.  It benchmarks software
# RX path just after NIC driver level.  With bursting is also
# "removes" the SKB alloc/free overhead.
#
# Setup scenarios for measuring ingress qdisc (with invalid dst_mac):
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# (1) no ingress (uses static_key_false(&ingress_needed))
#
# (2) ingress on other dev (change ingress_needed and calls
#     handle_ing() but exit early)
#
#  config:  tc qdisc add dev $SOMEDEV handle ffff: ingress
#
# (3) ingress on this dev, handle_ing() -> tc_classify()
#
#  config:  tc qdisc add dev $DEV handle ffff: ingress
#
# (4) ingress on this dev + drop at u32 classifier/action.
