==============

NAME
----
perf-report - Read perf.data (created by perf record) and display the profile

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf report' [-i <file> | --input=file]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command displays the performance counter profile information recorded
via perf record.

OPTIONS
-------
-i::
--input=::
        Input file name. (default: perf.data unless stdin is a fifo)

-v::
--verbose::
        Be more verbose. (show symbol address, etc)

-d::
--dsos=::
	Only consider symbols in these dsos. CSV that understands
	file://filename entries.
-n::
--show-nr-samples::
	Show the number of samples for each symbol

--showcpuutilization::
        Show sample percentage for different cpu modes.

-T::
--threads::
	Show per-thread event counters
-c::
--comms=::
	Only consider symbols in these comms. CSV that understands
	file://filename entries.
-S::
--symbols=::
	Only consider these symbols. CSV that understands
	file://filename entries.

--symbol-filter=::
	Only show symbols that match (partially) with this filter.

-U::
--hide-unresolved::
        Only display entries resolved to a symbol.

-s::
--sort=::
	Sort histogram entries by given key(s) - multiple keys can be specified
	in CSV format.  Following sort keys are available:
	pid, comm, dso, symbol, parent, cpu, srcline, weight, local_weight.

	Each key has following meaning:

	- comm: command (name) of the task which can be read via /proc/<pid>/comm
	- pid: command and tid of the task
	- dso: name of library or module executed at the time of sample
	- symbol: name of function executed at the time of sample
	- parent: name of function matched to the parent regex filter. Unmatched
	entries are displayed as "[other]".
	- cpu: cpu number the task ran at the time of sample
	- srcline: filename and line number executed at the time of sample.  The
	DWARF debugging info must be provided.
	- weight: Event specific weight, e.g. memory latency or transaction
	abort cost. This is the global weight.
	- local_weight: Local weight version of the weight above.
	- transaction: Transaction abort flags.

	By default, comm, dso and symbol keys are used.
	(i.e. --sort comm,dso,symbol)

	If --branch-stack option is used, following sort keys are also
	available:
	dso_from, dso_to, symbol_from, symbol_to, mispredict.

	- dso_from: name of library or module branched from
	- dso_to: name of library or module branched to
	- symbol_from: name of function branched from
	- symbol_to: name of function branched to
	- mispredict: "N" for predicted branch, "Y" for mispredicted branch
	- in_tx: branch in TSX transaction
	- abort: TSX transaction abort.

	And default sort keys are changed to comm, dso_from, symbol_from, dso_to
	and symbol_to, see '--branch-stack'.

-p::
--parent=<regex>::
        A regex filter to identify parent. The parent is a caller of this
	function and searched through the callchain, thus it requires callchain
	information recorded. The pattern is in the exteneded regex format and
	defaults to "\^sys_|^do_page_fault", see '--sort parent'.

-x::
--exclude-other::
        Only display entries with parent-match.

-w::
--column-widths=<width[,width...]>::
	Force each column width to the provided list, for large terminal
	readability.

-t::
--field-separator=::
	Use a special separator character and don't pad with spaces, replacing
	all occurrences of this separator in symbol names (and other output)
	with a '.' character, that thus it's the only non valid separator.

-D::
--dump-raw-trace::
        Dump raw trace in ASCII.

-g [type,min[,limit],order[,key]]::
--call-graph::
        Display call chains using type, min percent threshold, optional print
	limit and order.
	type can be either:
	- flat: single column, linear exposure of call chains.
	- graph: use a graph tree, displaying absolute overhead rates.
	- fractal: like graph, but displays relative rates. Each branch of
		 the tree is considered as a new profiled object. +

	order can be either:
	- callee: callee based call graph.
	- caller: inverted caller based call graph.

	key can be:
	- function: compare on functions
	- address: compare on individual code addresses

	Default: fractal,0.5,callee,function.

--max-stack::
	Set the stack depth limit when parsing the callchain, anything
	beyond the specified depth will be ignored. This is a trade-off
	between information loss and faster processing especially for
	workloads that can have a very long callchain stack.

	Default: 127

-G::
--inverted::
        alias for inverted caller based call graph.

--ignore-callees=<regex>::
        Ignore callees of the function(s) matching the given regex.
        This has the effect of collecting the callers of each such
        function into one place in the call-graph tree.

--pretty=<key>::
        Pretty printing style.  key: normal, raw

--stdio:: Use the stdio interface.

--tui:: Use the TUI interface, that is integrated with annotate and allows
        zooming into DSOs or threads, among other features. Use of --tui
	requires a tty, if one is not present, as when piping to other
	commands, the stdio interface is used.

--gtk:: Use the GTK2 interface.

-k::
--vmlinux=<file>::
        vmlinux pathname

--kallsyms=<file>::
        kallsyms pathname

-m::
--modules::
        Load module symbols. WARNING: This should only be used with -k and
        a LIVE kernel.

-f::
--force::
        Don't complain, do it.

--symfs=<directory>::
        Look for files with symbols relative to this directory.

-C::
--cpu:: Only report samples for the list of CPUs provided. Multiple CPUs can
	be provided as a comma-separated list with no space: 0,1. Ranges of
	CPUs are specified with -: 0-2. Default is to report samples on all
	CPUs.

-M::
--disassembler-style=:: Set disassembler style for objdump.

--source::
	Interleave source code with assembly code. Enabled by default,
	disable with --no-source.

--asm-raw::
	Show raw instruction encoding of assembly instructions.

--show-total-period:: Show a column with the sum of periods.

-I::
--show-info::
	Display extended information about the perf.data file. This adds
	information which may be very large and thus may clutter the display.
	It currently includes: cpu and numa topology of the host system.

-b::
--branch-stack::
	Use the addresses of sampled taken branches instead of the instruction
	address to build the histograms. To generate meaningful output, the
	perf.data file must have been obtained using perf record -b or
	perf record --branch-filter xxx where xxx is a branch filter option.
	perf report is able to auto-detect whether a perf.data file contains
	branch stacks and it will automatically switch to the branch view mode,
	unless --no-branch-stack is used.

--objdump=<path>::
        Path to objdump binary.

--group::
	Show event group information together.

--demangle::
	Demangle symbol names to human readable form. It's enabled by default,
	disable with --no-demangle.

--percent-limit::
	Do not show entries which have an overhead under that percent.
	(Default: 0).
