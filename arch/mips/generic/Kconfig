	  Select this from your board if the board must use a legacy, non-UHI,
	  boot protocol. This will cause the kernel to scan through the list of
	  supported machines calling their detect functions in turn if the
	  kernel is booted without being provided with an FDT via the UHI
	  boot protocol.

	  Enable this to include support for booting on MIPS SEAD-3 FPGA-based
	  development boards, which boot using a legacy boot protocol.
