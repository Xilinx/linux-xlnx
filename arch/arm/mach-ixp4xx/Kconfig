config IXP4XX_INDIRECT_PCI
	bool "Use indirect PCI memory access"
	depends on PCI
	help
          IXP4xx provides two methods of accessing PCI memory space:

          1) A direct mapped window from 0x48000000 to 0x4bffffff (64MB).
             To access PCI via this space, we simply ioremap() the BAR
             into the kernel and we can use the standard read[bwl]/write[bwl]
             macros. This is the preferred method due to speed but it
             limits the system to just 64MB of PCI memory. This can be 
             problematic if using video cards and other memory-heavy devices.
          
          2) If > 64MB of memory space is required, the IXP4xx can be 
	     configured to use indirect registers to access PCI This allows 
	     for up to 128MB (0x48000000 to 0x4fffffff) of memory on the bus. 
	     The disadvantage of this is that every PCI access requires 
	     three local register accesses plus a spinlock, but in some 
	     cases the performance hit is acceptable. In addition, you cannot 
	     mmap() PCI devices in this case due to the indirect nature
	     of the PCI window.

	  By default, the direct method is used. Choose this option if you
	  need to use the indirect method instead. If you don't know
	  what you need, leave this option unselected.

config IXP4XX_CLOCK_FORCE
	bool "Select the master clock frequency"
	depends on ARCH_IXP4XX
	help
	  Some hardware platforms using the IXP4XX CPU family use a non-
	  standard clock frequency. Select this option so you can specify
	  the actual clock frequency input to the CPU.
	
config IXP4XX_CLOCK
	int "Select the core clock frequency"
	default "66666666"
	depends on IXP4XX_CLOCK_FORCE
	help
	  You can set the actual CPU master clock frequency here, so that
	  you get accurate kernel timing. For example some platforms use a
	  66MHz crystal instead of a 66.666666MHz.

config IXP4XX_DEBUG_FIQ
	bool "Select IXP4XX button FIQ debug support"
	default n
	help
	  Enable the Factory "Erase" switch on the SnapGear hardware
	  platforms to be a debug FIQ. When pushed it will dump the
	  PC address that it interrupted. Useful for debugging hang and
	  lockup conditions since the FIQ can and will interrupt on top
	  of standard interrupts and when standard interrupts are locked
	  out.
