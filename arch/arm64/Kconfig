	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 826319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 4 ACE or
	  AXI master interface and an L2 cache.

	  If a Cortex-A53 uses an AMBA AXI4 ACE interface to other processors
	  and is unable to accept a certain write via this interface, it will
	  not progress on read data presented on the read data channel and the
	  system can deadlock.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 827319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 5 CHI
	  master interface and an L2 cache.

	  Under certain conditions this erratum can cause a clean line eviction
	  to occur at the same time as another transaction to the same address
	  on the AMBA 5 CHI interface, which can cause data corruption if the
	  interconnect reorders the two transactions.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  If a Cortex-A53 processor is executing a store or prefetch for

	  If the processor is executing a load and store exclusive sequence at

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might deadlock when exclusive load/store
	  instructions to Write-Back memory are mixed with Device loads.

	  The workaround is to promote device loads to use Load-Acquire

	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 834220 on Cortex-A57 parts up to r1p2.

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might report a Stage 2 translation
	  fault as the result of a Stage 1 fault for load crossing a
	  page boundary when there is a permission or device memory
	  alignment fault at Stage 1 and a translation fault at Stage 2.

	  The workaround is to verify that the Stage 1 translation
	  doesn't generate a fault before handling the Stage 2 fault.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,

	  part, a load at EL0 from a virtual address that matches the bottom 32
	  bits of the virtual address used by a recent load at (AArch64) EL1
	  might return incorrect data.

	  The workaround is to write the contextidr_el1 register on exception
	  return to a 32-bit task.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,

	    erratum 22375: only alloc 8MB table size

	help
	  ARMv8 obsoletes the use of A32 SWP/SWPB instructions such that
	  they are always undefined. Say Y here to enable software
	  emulation of these instructions for userspace using LDXR/STXR.

	  In some older versions of glibc [<=2.8] SWP is used during futex
	  trylock() operations with the assumption that the code will not
	  be preempted. This invalid assumption may be more likely to fail
	  with SWP emulation enabled, leading to deadlock of the user
	  application.

	  NOTE: when accessing uncached shared regions, LDXR/STXR rely
	  on an external transaction monitoring block called a global
	  monitor to maintain update atomicity. If your system does not
	  implement a global monitor, this option can cause programs that
	  perform SWP operations to uncached memory to deadlock.

	  If unsure, say Y

config CP15_BARRIER_EMULATION
	bool "Emulate CP15 Barrier instructions"
	help
	  The CP15 barrier instructions - CP15ISB, CP15DSB, and
	  CP15DMB - are deprecated in ARMv8 (and ARMv7). It is
	  strongly recommended to use the ISB, DSB, and DMB
	  instructions instead.

	  Say Y here to enable software emulation of these
	  instructions for AArch32 userspace code. When this option is
	  enabled, CP15 barrier usage is traced which can help
	  identify software that needs updating.

	  If unsure, say Y

config SETEND_EMULATION
	bool "Emulate SETEND instruction"
	help
	  The SETEND instruction alters the data-endianness of the
	  AArch32 EL0, and is deprecated in ARMv8.

	  Say Y here to enable software emulation of the instruction
	  for AArch32 userspace code.

	  Note: All the cpus on the system must have mixed endian support at EL0
	  for this feature to be enabled. If a new CPU - which doesn't support mixed
	  endian - is hotplugged in after this feature has been enabled, there could
	  be unexpected results in the applications.

config ARM64_HW_AFDBM

	default y
	help
	  The ARMv8.1 architecture extensions introduce support for
	  hardware updates of the access and dirty information in page
	  table entries. When enabled in TCR_EL1 (HA and HD bits) on
	  capable processors, accesses to pages with PTE_AF cleared will
	  set this bit instead of raising an access flag fault.
	  Similarly, writes to read-only pages with the DBM bit set will
	  clear the read-only bit (AP[2]) instead of raising a
	  permission fault.

	  Kernels built with this configuration option enabled continue
	  to work on pre-ARMv8.1 hardware and the performance impact is
	  minimal. If unsure, say Y.

config ARM64_PAN
	bool "Enable support for Privileged Access Never (PAN)"
	default y
	help
	 Privileged Access Never (PAN; part of the ARMv8.1 Extensions)
	 prevents the kernel or hypervisor from accessing user-space (EL0)
	 memory directly.

	 Choosing this option will cause any unprotected (not using
	 copy_to_user et al) memory access to fail with a permission fault.

	 The feature is detected at runtime, and will remain as a 'nop'
	 instruction if the cpu does not implement the feature.

config ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS
	bool "Atomic instructions"
	help
	  As part of the Large System Extensions, ARMv8.1 introduces new
	  atomic instructions that are designed specifically to scale in
	  very large systems.

	  Say Y here to make use of these instructions for the in-kernel
	  atomic routines. This incurs a small overhead on CPUs that do
	  not support these instructions and requires the kernel to be
	  built with binutils >= 2.25.

config ARM64_VHE
	bool "Enable support for Virtualization Host Extensions (VHE)"
	default y
	help
	  Virtualization Host Extensions (VHE) allow the kernel to run
	  directly at EL2 (instead of EL1) on processors that support
	  it. This leads to better performance for KVM, as they reduce
	  the cost of the world switch.

	  Selecting this option allows the VHE feature to be detected
	  at runtime, and does not affect processors that do not
	  implement this feature.

config ARM64_UAO

	default y
	help
	  User Access Override (UAO; part of the ARMv8.2 Extensions)
	  causes the 'unprivileged' variant of the load/store instructions to
	  be overriden to be privileged.

	  This option changes get_user() and friends to use the 'unprivileged'
	  variant of the load/store instructions. This ensures that user-space
	  really did have access to the supplied memory. When addr_limit is
	  set to kernel memory the UAO bit will be set, allowing privileged
	  access to kernel memory.

	  Choosing this option will cause copy_to_user() et al to use user-space
	  memory permissions.

	  The feature is detected at runtime, the kernel will use the
	  regular load/store instructions if the cpu does not implement the
	  feature.

	  This builds the kernel as a Position Independent Executable (PIE),
	  which retains all relocation metadata required to relocate the
	  kernel binary at runtime to a different virtual address than the
	  address it was linked at.
	  Since AArch64 uses the RELA relocation format, this requires a

	help
	  Randomizes the virtual address at which the kernel image is
	  loaded, as a security feature that deters exploit attempts
	  relying on knowledge of the location of kernel internals.

	  It is the bootloader's job to provide entropy, by passing a
	  random u64 value in /chosen/kaslr-seed at kernel entry.

	  When booting via the UEFI stub, it will invoke the firmware's
	  EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL implementation (if available) to supply entropy
	  to the kernel proper. In addition, it will randomise the physical
	  location of the kernel Image as well.

	  If unsure, say N.

config RANDOMIZE_MODULE_REGION_FULL
	bool "Randomize the module region independently from the core kernel"
	depends on RANDOMIZE_BASE && !DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	default y
	help
	  Randomizes the location of the module region without considering the
	  location of the core kernel. This way, it is impossible for modules
	  to leak information about the location of core kernel data structures
	  but it does imply that function calls between modules and the core
	  kernel will need to be resolved via veneers in the module PLT.

	  When this option is not set, the module region will be randomized over
	  a limited range that contains the [_stext, _etext] interval of the
	  core kernel, so branch relocations are always in range.
