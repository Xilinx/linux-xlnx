	select QCOM_SCM
	help
	  QCOM Platform specific power driver to manage cores and L2 low power
	  modes. It interface with various system drivers to put the cores in
	  low power modes.

config QCOM_SMEM
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager (SMEM)"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM
	depends on HWSPINLOCK
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Manager.
	  The driver provides an interface to items in a heap shared among all
	  processors in a Qualcomm platform.

config QCOM_SMD
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver (SMD)"
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver
	  providing communication channels to remote processors in Qualcomm

	depends on QCOM_SMD && OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  Resource Power Manager system found in the Qualcomm 8974 based
	  devices.

	  This is required to access many regulators, clocks and bus
	  frequencies controlled by the RPM on these devices.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for the Qualcomm RPM as a
	  module. This will build a module called "qcom-smd-rpm".
