config FPGA
	tristate "FPGA Configuration Framework"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for configuring FPGAs from the
	  kernel.  The FPGA framework adds a FPGA manager class and FPGA
	  manager drivers.

config FPGA_REGION
	tristate "FPGA Region"
	depends on OF && FPGA_BRIDGE
	help
	  FPGA Regions allow loading FPGA images under control of
	  the Device Tree.

config FPGA_MGR_SOCFPGA
	tristate "Altera SOCFPGA FPGA Manager"
	depends on ARCH_SOCFPGA
	help
	  FPGA manager driver support for Altera SOCFPGA.
