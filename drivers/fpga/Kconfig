config FPGA
	tristate "FPGA Configuration Framework"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want support for configuring FPGAs from the
	  kernel.  The FPGA framework adds a FPGA manager class and FPGA
	  manager drivers.

config FPGA_BRIDGE
	bool "FPGA Bridge Framework"
	depends on OF
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support bridges connected between host
	  processors and FPGAs or between FPGAs.

config FPGA_MGR_SOCFPGA
	tristate "Altera SOCFPGA FPGA Manager"
	depends on ARCH_SOCFPGA
	help
	  FPGA manager driver support for Altera SOCFPGA.

config FPGA_MGR_ZYNQ_FPGA
	tristate "Xilinx Zynq FPGA"
	help
	  FPGA manager driver support for Xilinx Zynq FPGAs.

config FPGA_AREA
	bool "Device Tree Based FPGA Reprogramming"
	depends on FPGA_BRIDGE
	help
	  Enable FPGA Area which supports programming FPGAs under control of Device Tree.

config SOCFPGA_FPGA_BRIDGE
	bool "Altera SoCFPGA FPGA Bridges"
	depends on ARCH_SOCFPGA && FPGA_BRIDGE
	help
	  Say Y to enable drivers for FPGA bridges for Altera SOCFPGA devices.
