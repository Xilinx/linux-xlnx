/*
 * Deferred Probe infrastructure.
 *
 * Sometimes driver probe order matters, but the kernel doesn't always have
 * dependency information which means some drivers will get probed before a
 * resource it depends on is available.  For example, an SDHCI driver may
 * first need a GPIO line from an i2c GPIO controller before it can be
 * initialized.  If a required resource is not available yet, a driver can
 * request probing to be deferred by returning -EPROBE_DEFER from its probe hook
 *
 * Deferred probe maintains two lists of devices, a pending list and an active
 * list.  A driver returning -EPROBE_DEFER causes the device to be added to the
 * pending list.  A successful driver probe will trigger moving all devices
 * from the pending to the active list so that the workqueue will eventually
 * retry them.
 *
 * The deferred_probe_mutex must be held any time the deferred_probe_*_list
 * of the (struct device*)->p->deferred_probe pointers are manipulated
