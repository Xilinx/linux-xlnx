	  This option is selected by any driver which registers a
	  device or driver on the MIC Bus, such as CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_HOST,
	  CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_CARD, CONFIG_INTEL_MIC_X100_DMA etc.

	  If you are building a host/card kernel with an Intel MIC device
	  then say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	help
	  This enables Host Driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor devices that
	  run a 64 bit Linux OS. The driver manages card OS state and
	  enables communication between host and card. Intel MIC X100
	  devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	select VIRTIO
	help
	  This enables card driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) device family. The card driver communicates shutdown/
	  crash events to the host and allows registration/configuration of
	  virtio devices. Intel MIC X100 devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a card kernel for an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	select IOMMU_IOVA
	help
	  This enables SCIF Driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor devices that
	  run a 64 bit Linux OS. The Symmetric Communication Interface
	  (SCIF (pronounced as skiff)) is a low level communications API
	  across PCIe currently implemented for MIC.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	select VIRTIO
	help
	  This enables VOP (Virtio over PCIe) Driver support for the Intel
	  Many Integrated Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor
	  devices. The VOP driver allows virtio drivers, e.g. net, console
	  and block drivers, on the card connect to user space virtio
	  devices on the host.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.
