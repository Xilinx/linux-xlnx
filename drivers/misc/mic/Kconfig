	  This enables Host Driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) family of PCIe form factor coprocessor devices that
	  run a 64 bit Linux OS. The driver manages card OS state and
	  enables communication between host and card. Intel MIC X100
	  devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a host kernel with an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.

	  More information about the Intel MIC family as well as the Linux
	  OS and tools for MIC to use with this driver are available from

	select VIRTIO
	default N
	help
	  This enables card driver support for the Intel Many Integrated
	  Core (MIC) device family. The card driver communicates shutdown/
	  crash events to the host and allows registration/configuration of
	  virtio devices. Intel MIC X100 devices are currently supported.

	  If you are building a card kernel for an Intel MIC device then
	  say M (recommended) or Y, else say N. If unsure say N.
