	---help---
	  Most LCDs use a single address bit to differentiate line 0 and line 1. Since
	  some of them need to be able to address 40 chars with the lower bits, they
	  often use the immediately superior power of 2, which is 64, to address the
	  next line.

	  If you don't know what your LCD uses, in doubt let 16 here for a 2x16, and
	  64 here for a 2x40.

	int "LCD character set (0=normal, 1=KS0074)"
	range 0 1
	default 0
	---help---
	  Some controllers such as the KS0074 use a somewhat strange character set
	  where many symbols are at unusual places. The driver knows how to map
	  'standard' ASCII characters to the character sets used by these controllers.
	  Valid values are :

	     0 : normal (untranslated) character set
	     1 : KS0074 character set

	  If you don't know, use the normal one (0).

	range 0 1
	default 0
	---help---
	  This driver now supports any serial or parallel LCD wired to a parallel
	  port. But before assigning signals, the driver needs to know if it will
	  be driving a serial LCD or a parallel one. Serial LCDs only use 2 wires
	  (SDA/SCL), while parallel ones use 2 or 3 wires for the control signals
	  (E, RS, sometimes RW), and 4 or 8 for the data. Use 0 here for a 8 bits
	  parallel LCD, and 1 for a serial LCD.

config PANEL_CHANGE_MESSAGE

	---help---
	  This allows you to replace the boot message indicating the kernel version
	  and the driver version with a custom message. This is useful on appliances
	  where a simple 'Starting system' message can be enough to stop a customer
	  from worrying.

	  If you say 'Y' here, you'll be able to choose a message yourself. Otherwise,
	  say 'N' and keep the default message with the version.

config PANEL_BOOT_MESSAGE
	depends on PANEL && PANEL_CHANGE_MESSAGE="y"
	string "New initialization message"
	default ""
	---help---
	  This allows you to replace the boot message indicating the kernel version
	  and the driver version with a custom message. This is useful on appliances
	  where a simple 'Starting system' message can be enough to stop a customer
	  from worrying.

	  An empty message will only clear the display at driver init time. Any other
	  printf()-formatted message is valid with newline and escape codes.

	  This option enables support for the Xilinx SDFEC (Soft Decision

	  You may select this driver if your design instantiates the
