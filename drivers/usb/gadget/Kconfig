# USB Gadget support on a system involves
#    (a) a peripheral controller, and
#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of controllers.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	   For more information, see <http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget> and
	   the kernel DocBook documentation for this API.

	   Many controller and gadget drivers will print some debugging

	   Avoid enabling these messages, even if you're actively

	   Some devices need to draw power from USB when they are
	   configured, perhaps to operate circuitry or to recharge
	   batteries.  This is in addition to any local power supply,
	   such as an AC adapter or batteries.

	   Enter the maximum power your device draws through USB, in
	   milliAmperes.  The permitted range of values is 2 - 500 mA;
	   0 mA would be legal, but can make some hosts misbehave.

	   This value will be used except for system-specific gadget
	   drivers that have more specific information.

config USB_GADGET_STORAGE_NUM_BUFFERS
	int "Number of storage pipeline buffers"
	range 2 4
	default 2
	help
	   Usually 2 buffers are enough to establish a good buffering
	   pipeline. The number may be increased in order to compensate
	   for a bursty VFS behaviour. For instance there may be CPU wake up
	   latencies that makes the VFS to appear bursty in a system with
	   an CPU on-demand governor. Especially if DMA is doing IO to
	   offload the CPU. In this case the CPU will go into power
	   save often and spin up occasionally to move data within VFS.
	   If selecting USB_GADGET_DEBUG_FILES this value may be set by
	   a module parameter as well.
	   If unsure, say 2.

	  Gadget Zero is a two-configuration device.  It either sinks and
	  sources bulk data; or it loops back a configurable number of
	  transfers.  It also implements control requests, for "chapter 9"
	  conformance.  The driver needs only two bulk-capable endpoints, so
	  it can work on top of most device-side usb controllers.  It's
	  useful for testing, and is also a working example showing how
	  USB "gadget drivers" can be written.

	  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
	  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
	  test software, like the "usbtest" driver, to put your hardware
	  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,
	  and with many kinds of host-side test software.  You may need
	  to tweak product and vendor IDs before host software knows about
	  this device, and arrange to select an appropriate configuration.

	     That protocol is often avoided with pure Ethernet adapters, in
	     favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware, but is widely
	     supported by firmware for smart network devices.

	   - On hardware can't implement that protocol, a simple CDC subset
	     is used, placing fewer demands on USB.

	   - CDC Ethernet Emulation Model (EEM) is a newer standard that has
	     a simpler interface that can be used by more USB hardware.

	  RNDIS support is an additional option, more demanding than than
	  subset.

	  Within the USB device, this gadget driver exposes a network device
	  "usbX", where X depends on what other networking devices you have.
	  Treat it like a two-node Ethernet link:  host, and gadget.

	  The Linux-USB host-side "usbnet" driver interoperates with this
	  driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels,
	  use "CDCEther" instead, if you're using the CDC option. That CDC
