	help
	 The PCI-E Non-transparent bridge hardware is a point-to-point PCI-E bus
	 connecting 2 systems.  When configured, writes to the device's PCI
	 mapped memory will be mirrored to a buffer on the remote system.  The
	 ntb Linux driver uses this point-to-point communication as a method to
	 transfer data from one system to the other.

	 If unsure, say N.
