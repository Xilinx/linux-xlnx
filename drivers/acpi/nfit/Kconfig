	  Infrastructure to probe ACPI 6 compliant platforms for
	  NVDIMMs (NFIT) and register a libnvdimm device tree.  In
	  addition to storage devices this also enables libnvdimm to pass
	  ACPI._DSM messages for platform/dimm configuration.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called nfit.

config ACPI_NFIT_DEBUG

	default n
	help
	  Enabling this option causes the nfit driver to dump the
	  input and output buffers of _DSM operations on the ACPI0012
	  device and its children.  This can be very verbose, so leave
	  it disabled unless you are debugging a hardware / firmware
	  issue.
