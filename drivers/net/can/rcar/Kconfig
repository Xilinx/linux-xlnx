	  Say Y here if you want to use CAN controller found on Renesas R-Car
	  SoCs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will

config CAN_RCAR_CANFD

	depends on ARCH_RENESAS || ARM
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use CAN FD controller found on
	  Renesas R-Car SoCs. The driver puts the controller in CAN FD only
	  mode, which can interoperate with CAN2.0 nodes but does not support
	  dedicated CAN 2.0 mode.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called rcar_canfd.
