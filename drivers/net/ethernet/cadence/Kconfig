config NET_CADENCE
	bool "Cadence devices"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	default y
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the remaining Atmel network card questions. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_CADENCE

config MACB
	tristate "Cadence MACB/GEM support"
	depends on HAS_DMA
	select PHYLIB
	select PTP_1588_CLOCK
	---help---
	  The Cadence MACB ethernet interface is found on many Atmel AT32 and
	  AT91 parts.  This driver also supports the Cadence GEM (Gigabit
	  Ethernet MAC found in some ARM SoC devices).  Say Y to include
	  support for the MACB/GEM chip.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called macb.

config MACB_EXT_BD
	tristate "Cadence MACB/GEM extended buffer descriptor"
	depends on HAS_DMA && MACB
	---help---
	  The Cadence MACB host supports use of extended buffer descriptor.
	  This option enables additon of two extra words to TX BD and RX BD.
	  These two extra words are currently used to obtain PTP timestamp.
