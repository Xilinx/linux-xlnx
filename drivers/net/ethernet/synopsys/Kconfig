	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) device belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Synopsys devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific device in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_SYNOPSYS

	select PHYLIB
	select CRC32
	select MII
	depends on OF && HAS_DMA
	---help---
	  This driver supports the DWC Ethernet QoS from Synopsys
