config NET_VENDOR_MELLANOX
	bool "Mellanox devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Mellanox cards. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.
