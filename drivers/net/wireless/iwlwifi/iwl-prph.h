/**
 * Tx Scheduler
 *
 * The Tx Scheduler selects the next frame to be transmitted, choosing TFDs
 * (Transmit Frame Descriptors) from up to 16 circular Tx queues resident in
 * host DRAM.  It steers each frame's Tx command (which contains the frame
 * data) into one of up to 7 prioritized Tx DMA FIFO channels within the
 * device.  A queue maps to only one (selectable by driver) Tx DMA channel,
 * but one DMA channel may take input from several queues.
 *
 * Tx DMA FIFOs have dedicated purposes.
 *
 * For 5000 series and up, they are used differently
 * (cf. iwl5000_default_queue_to_tx_fifo in iwl-5000.c):
 *
 * 0 -- EDCA BK (background) frames, lowest priority
 * 1 -- EDCA BE (best effort) frames, normal priority
 * 2 -- EDCA VI (video) frames, higher priority
 * 3 -- EDCA VO (voice) and management frames, highest priority
 * 4 -- unused
 * 5 -- unused
 * 6 -- unused
 * 7 -- Commands
 *
 * Driver should normally map queues 0-6 to Tx DMA/FIFO channels 0-6.
 * In addition, driver can map the remaining queues to Tx DMA/FIFO
 * channels 0-3 to support 11n aggregation via EDCA DMA channels.
 *
 * The driver sets up each queue to work in one of two modes:
 *
 * 1)  Scheduler-Ack, in which the scheduler automatically supports a
 *     block-ack (BA) window of up to 64 TFDs.  In this mode, each queue
 *     contains TFDs for a unique combination of Recipient Address (RA)
 *     and Traffic Identifier (TID), that is, traffic of a given
 *     Quality-Of-Service (QOS) priority, destined for a single station.
 *
 *     In scheduler-ack mode, the scheduler keeps track of the Tx status of
 *     each frame within the BA window, including whether it's been transmitted,
 *     and whether it's been acknowledged by the receiving station.  The device
 *     automatically processes block-acks received from the receiving STA,
 *     and reschedules un-acked frames to be retransmitted (successful
 *     Tx completion may end up being out-of-order).
 *
 *     The driver must maintain the queue's Byte Count table in host DRAM
 *     for this mode.
 *     This mode does not support fragmentation.
 *
 * 2)  FIFO (a.k.a. non-Scheduler-ACK), in which each TFD is processed in order.
 *     The device may automatically retry Tx, but will retry only one frame
 *     at a time, until receiving ACK from receiving station, or reaching
 *     retry limit and giving up.
 *
 *     The command queue (#4/#9) must use this mode!
 *     This mode does not require use of the Byte Count table in host DRAM.
 *
 * Driver controls scheduler operation via 3 means:
 * 1)  Scheduler registers
 * 2)  Shared scheduler data base in internal SRAM
 * 3)  Shared data in host DRAM
 *
 * Initialization:
 *
 * When loading, driver should allocate memory for:
 * 1)  16 TFD circular buffers, each with space for (typically) 256 TFDs.
 * 2)  16 Byte Count circular buffers in 16 KBytes contiguous memory
 *     (1024 bytes for each queue).
 *
 * After receiving "Alive" response from uCode, driver must initialize
 * the scheduler (especially for queue #4/#9, the command queue, otherwise
 * the driver can't issue commands!):
