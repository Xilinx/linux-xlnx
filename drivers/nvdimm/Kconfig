	  Generic support for non-volatile memory devices including
	  ACPI-6-NFIT defined resources.  On platforms that define an
	  NFIT, or otherwise can discover NVDIMM resources, a libnvdimm
	  bus is registered to advertise PMEM (persistent memory)
	  namespaces (/dev/pmemX) and BLK (sliding mmio window(s))
	  namespaces (/dev/ndblkX.Y). A PMEM namespace refers to a
	  memory resource that may span multiple DIMMs and support DAX
	  (see CONFIG_DAX).  A BLK namespace refers to an NVDIMM control
	  region which exposes an mmio register set for windowed access
	  mode to non-volatile memory.

	  Memory ranges for PMEM are described by either an NFIT
	  (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table, see CONFIG_NFIT_ACPI), a
	  non-standard OEM-specific E820 memory type (type-12, see
	  CONFIG_X86_PMEM_LEGACY), or it is manually specified by the
	  'memmap=nn[KMG]!ss[KMG]' kernel command line (see
	  Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt).  This driver converts
	  these persistent memory ranges into block devices that are
	  capable of DAX (direct-access) file system mappings.  See
	  Documentation/nvdimm/nvdimm.txt for more details.

	  The Block Translation Table (BTT) provides atomic sector
	  update semantics for persistent memory devices, so that
	  applications that rely on sector writes not being torn (a
	  guarantee that typical disks provide) can continue to do so.
	  The BTT manifests itself as an alternate personality for an
	  NVDIMM namespace, i.e. a namespace can be in raw mode (pmemX,
	  ndblkX.Y, etc...), or 'sectored' mode, (pmemXs, ndblkX.Ys,
	  etc...).

	  Map persistent memory, i.e. advertise it to the memory
	  management sub-system.  By default persistent memory does
	  not support direct I/O, RDMA, or any other usage that
	  requires a 'struct page' to mediate an I/O request.  This
	  driver allocates and initializes the infrastructure needed
	  to support those use cases.

	  Support raw device dax access to a persistent memory
	  namespace.  For environments that want to hard partition
	  peristent memory, this capability provides a mechanism to
	  sub-divide a namespace into character devices that can only be
	  accessed via DAX (mmap(2)).
