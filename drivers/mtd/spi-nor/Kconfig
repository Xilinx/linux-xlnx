	  This enables access to SPI NOR flash, using MT81xx SPI NOR flash
	  controller. This controller does not support generic SPI BUS, it only
	  supports SPI NOR Flash.

config MTD_SPI_NOR_USE_4K_SECTORS
	bool "Use small 4096 B erase sectors"
	default y
	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

	  This enables support for the Quad SPI controller in master mode.
	  This driver does not support generic SPI. The implementation only
	  supports SPI NOR.

	  Enable support for the Cadence Quad SPI Flash controller.

	  Cadence QSPI is a specialized controller for connecting an SPI
	  Flash over 1/2/4-bit wide bus. Enable this option if you have a
	  device with a Cadence QSPI controller and want to access the
	  Flash as an MTD device.

	  SPIFI is a specialized controller for connecting serial SPI
	  Flash. Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFI
	  controller and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.
