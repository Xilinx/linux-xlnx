	help
	  A System Trace Module (STM) is a device exporting data in System
	  Trace Protocol (STP) format as defined by MIPI STP standards.
	  Examples of such devices are Intel(R) Trace Hub and Coresight STM.

	  Say Y here to enable System Trace Module device support.

config STM_DUMMY
	tristate "Dummy STM driver"
	help
	  This is a simple dummy device that pretends to be an stm device
	  and discards your data. Use for stm class testing.

	  If you don't know what this is, say N.

config STM_SOURCE_CONSOLE
	tristate "Kernel console over STM devices"
	help
	  This is a kernel space trace source that sends kernel log
	  messages to trace hosts over STM devices.

	  If you want to send kernel console messages over STM devices,
	  say Y.

config STM_SOURCE_HEARTBEAT
	tristate "Heartbeat over STM devices"
	help
	  This is a kernel space trace source that sends periodic
	  heartbeat messages to trace hosts over STM devices. It is
	  also useful for testing stm class drivers and the stm class
	  framework itself.

	  If you want to send heartbeat messages over STM devices,
	  say Y.
