config NVME_CORE

config BLK_DEV_NVME

	depends on PCI && BLOCK
	select NVME_CORE
	---help---
	  The NVM Express driver is for solid state drives directly
	  connected to the PCI or PCI Express bus.  If you know you
	  don't have one of these, it is safe to answer N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nvme.

config BLK_DEV_NVME_SCSI
	bool "SCSI emulation for NVMe device nodes"
	depends on NVME_CORE
	---help---
	  This adds support for the SG_IO ioctl on the NVMe character
	  and block devices nodes, as well as a translation for a small
	  number of selected SCSI commands to NVMe commands to the NVMe
	  driver.  If you don't know what this means you probably want
	  to say N here, unless you run a distro that abuses the SCSI
	  emulation to provide stable device names for mount by id, like
	  some OpenSuSE and SLES versions.

config NVME_FABRICS
	tristate

config NVME_RDMA
	tristate "NVM Express over Fabrics RDMA host driver"
	depends on INFINIBAND && BLOCK
	select NVME_CORE
	select NVME_FABRICS
	select SG_POOL
	help
	  This provides support for the NVMe over Fabrics protocol using
	  the RDMA (Infiniband, RoCE, iWarp) transport.  This allows you
	  to use remote block devices exported using the NVMe protocol set.

	  To configure a NVMe over Fabrics controller use the nvme-cli tool
	  from https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli.

	  If unsure, say N.
