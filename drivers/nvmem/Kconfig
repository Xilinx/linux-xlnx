	tristate "NVMEM Support"
	help
	  Support for NVMEM(Non Volatile Memory) devices like EEPROM, EFUSES...

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface to NVMEM
	  from both the Linux Kernel and the userspace.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module
	  will be called nvmem_core.

	  If unsure, say no.
