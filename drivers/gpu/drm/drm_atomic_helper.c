/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * This helper library provides implementations of check and commit functions on
 * top of the CRTC modeset helper callbacks and the plane helper callbacks. It
 * also provides convenience implementations for the atomic state handling
 * callbacks for drivers which don't need to subclass the drm core structures to
 * add their own additional internal state.
 *
 * This library also provides default implementations for the check callback in
 * drm_atomic_helper_check() and for the commit callback with
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit(). But the individual stages and callbacks are
 * exposed to allow drivers to mix and match and e.g. use the plane helpers only
 * together with a driver private modeset implementation.
 *
 * This library also provides implementations for all the legacy driver
 * interfaces on top of the atomic interface. See drm_atomic_helper_set_config(),
 * drm_atomic_helper_disable_plane(), drm_atomic_helper_disable_plane() and the
 * various functions to implement set_property callbacks. New drivers must not
 * implement these functions themselves but must use the provided helpers.
 *
 * The atomic helper uses the same function table structures as all other
 * modesetting helpers. See the documentation for struct &drm_crtc_helper_funcs,
 * struct &drm_encoder_helper_funcs and struct &drm_connector_helper_funcs. It
 * also shares the struct &drm_plane_helper_funcs function table with the plane
 * helpers.

/**
 * DOC: implementing nonblocking commit
 *
 * Nonblocking atomic commits have to be implemented in the following sequence:
 *
 * 1. Run drm_atomic_helper_prepare_planes() first. This is the only function
 * which commit needs to call which can fail, so we want to run it first and
 * synchronously.
 *
 * 2. Synchronize with any outstanding nonblocking commit worker threads which
 * might be affected the new state update. This can be done by either cancelling
 * or flushing the work items, depending upon whether the driver can deal with
 * cancelled updates. Note that it is important to ensure that the framebuffer
 * cleanup is still done when cancelling.
 *
 * Asynchronous workers need to have sufficient parallelism to be able to run
 * different atomic commits on different CRTCs in parallel. The simplest way to
 * achive this is by running them on the &system_unbound_wq work queue. Note
 * that drivers are not required to split up atomic commits and run an
 * individual commit in parallel - userspace is supposed to do that if it cares.
 * But it might be beneficial to do that for modesets, since those necessarily
 * must be done as one global operation, and enabling or disabling a CRTC can
 * take a long time. But even that is not required.
 *
 * 3. The software state is updated synchronously with
 * drm_atomic_helper_swap_state(). Doing this under the protection of all modeset
 * locks means concurrent callers never see inconsistent state. And doing this
 * while it's guaranteed that no relevant nonblocking worker runs means that
 * nonblocking workers do not need grab any locks. Actually they must not grab
 * locks, for otherwise the work flushing will deadlock.
 *
 * 4. Schedule a work item to do all subsequent steps, using the split-out
 * commit helpers: a) pre-plane commit b) plane commit c) post-plane commit and
 * then cleaning up the framebuffers after the old framebuffer is no longer
 * being displayed.
 *
 * The above scheme is implemented in the atomic helper libraries in
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit() using a bunch of helper functions. See
 * drm_atomic_helper_setup_commit() for a starting point.

 * This function prepares @state to be used by the atomic helper's support for
 * nonblocking commits. Drivers using the nonblocking commit infrastructure
 * should always call this function from their ->atomic_commit hook.
 *
 * To be able to use this support drivers need to use a few more helper
 * functions. drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_dependencies() must be called before
 * actually committing the hardware state, and for nonblocking commits this call
 * must be placed in the async worker. See also drm_atomic_helper_swap_state()
 * and it's stall parameter, for when a driver's commit hooks look at the
 * ->state pointers of struct &drm_crtc, &drm_plane or &drm_connector directly.
 *
 * Completion of the hardware commit step must be signalled using
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_hw_done(). After this step the driver is not allowed
 * to read or change any permanent software or hardware modeset state. The only
 * exception is state protected by other means than &drm_modeset_lock locks.
 * Only the free standing @state with pointers to the old state structures can
 * be inspected, e.g. to clean up old buffers using
 * drm_atomic_helper_cleanup_planes().
 *
 * At the very end, before cleaning up @state drivers must call
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_cleanup_done().
 *
 * This is all implemented by in drm_atomic_helper_commit(), giving drivers a
 * complete and esay-to-use default implementation of the atomic_commit() hook.
 *
 * The tracking of asynchronously executed and still pending commits is done
 * using the core structure &drm_crtc_commit.
 *
 * By default there's no need to clean up resources allocated by this function
 * explicitly: drm_atomic_state_default_clear() will take care of that
 * automatically.

 *
 * This function commits the new plane state using the plane and atomic helper
 * functions for planes and crtcs. It assumes that the atomic state has already
 * been pushed into the relevant object state pointers, since this step can no
 * longer fail.
 *
 * It still requires the global state object @old_state to know which planes and
 * crtcs need to be updated though.
 *
 * Note that this function does all plane updates across all CRTCs in one step.
 * If the hardware can't support this approach look at
 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_planes_on_crtc() instead.
 *
 * Plane parameters can be updated by applications while the associated CRTC is
 * disabled. The DRM/KMS core will store the parameters in the plane state,
 * which will be available to the driver when the CRTC is turned on. As a result
 * most drivers don't need to be immediately notified of plane updates for a
 * disabled CRTC.
 *
 * Unless otherwise needed, drivers are advised to set the ACTIVE_ONLY flag in
 * @flags in order not to receive plane update notifications related to a
 * disabled CRTC. This avoids the need to manually ignore plane updates in
 * driver code when the driver and/or hardware can't or just don't need to deal
 * with updates on disabled CRTCs, for example when supporting runtime PM.
 *
 * Drivers may set the NO_DISABLE_AFTER_MODESET flag in @flags if the relevant
 * display controllers require to disable a CRTC's planes when the CRTC is
 * disabled. This function would skip the ->atomic_disable call for a plane if
 * the CRTC of the old plane state needs a modesetting operation. Of course,
 * the drivers need to disable the planes in their CRTC disable callbacks
 * since no one else would do that.
 *
 * The drm_atomic_helper_commit() default implementation doesn't set the
 * ACTIVE_ONLY flag to most closely match the behaviour of the legacy helpers.
 * This should not be copied blindly by drivers.

 * suspend. One way to solve this is to have a hardware state read-out

 * driver).
 *
 * The simpler solution is to just reset the software state to everything off,
 * which is easiest to do by calling drm_mode_config_reset(). To facilitate this
 * the atomic helpers provide default reset implementations for all hooks.
 *
 * On the upside the precise state tracking of atomic simplifies system suspend
 * and resume a lot. For drivers using drm_mode_config_reset() a complete recipe
 * is implemented in drm_atomic_helper_suspend() and drm_atomic_helper_resume().
 * For other drivers the building blocks are split out, see the documentation
