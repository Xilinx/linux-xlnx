menuconfig DRM_LEGACY
	bool "Enable legacy drivers (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Enable legacy DRI1 drivers. Those drivers expose unsafe and dangerous
	  APIs to user-space, which can be used to circumvent access
	  restrictions and other security measures. For backwards compatibility
	  those drivers are still available, but their use is highly
	  inadvisable and might harm your system.

	  You are recommended to use the safe modeset-only drivers instead, and
	  perform 3D emulation in user-space.

	  Unless you have strong reasons to go rogue, say "N".
