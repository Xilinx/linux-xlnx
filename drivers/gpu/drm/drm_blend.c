/**
 * DOC: overview
 *
 * The basic plane composition model supported by standard plane properties only
 * has a source rectangle (in logical pixels within the &drm_framebuffer), with
 * sub-pixel accuracy, which is scaled up to a pixel-aligned destination
 * rectangle in the visible area of a &drm_crtc. The visible area of a CRTC is
 * defined by the horizontal and vertical visible pixels (stored in @hdisplay
 * and @vdisplay) of the requested mode (stored in @mode in the
 * &drm_crtc_state). These two rectangles are both stored in the
 * &drm_plane_state.
 *
 * For the atomic ioctl the following standard (atomic) properties on the plane object
 * encode the basic plane composition model:
 *
 * SRC_X:
 * 	X coordinate offset for the source rectangle within the
 * 	&drm_framebuffer, in 16.16 fixed point. Must be positive.
 * SRC_Y:
 * 	Y coordinate offset for the source rectangle within the
 * 	&drm_framebuffer, in 16.16 fixed point. Must be positive.
 * SRC_W:
 * 	Width for the source rectangle within the &drm_framebuffer, in 16.16
 * 	fixed point. SRC_X plus SRC_W must be within the width of the source
 * 	framebuffer. Must be positive.
 * SRC_H:
 * 	Height for the source rectangle within the &drm_framebuffer, in 16.16
 * 	fixed point. SRC_Y plus SRC_H must be within the height of the source
 * 	framebuffer. Must be positive.
 * CRTC_X:
 * 	X coordinate offset for the destination rectangle. Can be negative.
 * CRTC_Y:
 * 	Y coordinate offset for the destination rectangle. Can be negative.
 * CRTC_W:
 * 	Width for the destination rectangle. CRTC_X plus CRTC_W can extend past
 * 	the currently visible horizontal area of the &drm_crtc.
 * CRTC_H:
 * 	Height for the destination rectangle. CRTC_Y plus CRTC_H can extend past
 * 	the currently visible vertical area of the &drm_crtc.
 * FB_ID:
 * 	Mode object ID of the &drm_framebuffer this plane should scan out.
 * CRTC_ID:
 * 	Mode object ID of the &drm_crtc this plane should be connected to.
 *
 * Note that the source rectangle must fully lie within the bounds of the
 * &drm_framebuffer. The destination rectangle can lie outside of the visible
 * area of the current mode of the CRTC. It must be apprpriately clipped by the
 * driver, which can be done by calling drm_plane_helper_check_update(). Drivers
 * are also allowed to round the subpixel sampling positions appropriately, but
 * only to the next full pixel. No pixel outside of the source rectangle may
 * ever be sampled, which is important when applying more sophisticated
 * filtering than just a bilinear one when scaling. The filtering mode when
 * scaling is unspecified.
 *
 * On top of this basic transformation additional properties can be exposed by
 * the driver:
 *
 * - Rotation is set up with drm_mode_create_rotation_property(). It adds a
 *   rotation and reflection step between the source and destination rectangles.
 *   Without this property the rectangle is only scaled, but not rotated or
 *   reflected.
 *
 * - Z position is set up with drm_plane_create_zpos_immutable_property() and
 *   drm_plane_create_zpos_property(). It controls the visibility of overlapping
 *   planes. Without this property the primary plane is always below the cursor
 *   plane, and ordering between all other planes is undefined.
 *
 * Note that all the property extensions described here apply either to the
 * plane or the CRTC (e.g. for the background color, which currently is not
 * exposed and assumed to be black).

/**
 * drm_mode_create_rotation_property - create a new rotation property
 * @dev: DRM device
 * @supported_rotations: bitmask of supported rotations and reflections
 *
 * This creates a new property with the selected support for transformations.
 * The resulting property should be stored in @rotation_property in
 * &drm_mode_config. It then must be attached to each plane which supports
 * rotations using drm_object_attach_property().
 *
 * FIXME: Probably better if the rotation property is created on each plane,
 * like the zpos property. Otherwise it's not possible to allow different
 * rotation modes on different planes.
 *
 * Since a rotation by 180Â° degress is the same as reflecting both along the x
 * and the y axis the rotation property is somewhat redundant. Drivers can use
 * drm_rotation_simplify() to normalize values of this property.
 *
 * The property exposed to userspace is a bitmask property (see
 * drm_property_create_bitmask()) called "rotation" and has the following
 * bitmask enumaration values:
 *
 * DRM_ROTATE_0:
 * 	"rotate-0"
 * DRM_ROTATE_90:
 * 	"rotate-90"
 * DRM_ROTATE_180:
 * 	"rotate-180"
 * DRM_ROTATE_270:
 * 	"rotate-270"
 * DRM_REFLECT_X:
 * 	"reflect-x"
 * DRM_REFELCT_Y:
 * 	"reflect-y"
 *
 * Rotation is the specified amount in degrees in counter clockwise direction,
 * the X and Y axis are within the source rectangle, i.e.  the X/Y axis before
 * rotation. After reflection, the rotation is applied to the image sampled from
 * the source rectangle, before scaling it to fit the destination rectangle.
