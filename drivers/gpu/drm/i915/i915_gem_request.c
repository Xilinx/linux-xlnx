 * @rps: client to charge for RPS boosting
 *
 * Note: It is of utmost importance that the passed in seqno and reset_counter
 * values have been read by the caller in an smp safe manner. Where read-side
 * locks are involved, it is sufficient to read the reset_counter before
 * unlocking the lock that protects the seqno. For lockless tricks, the
 * reset_counter _must_ be read before, and an appropriate smp_rmb must be
 * inserted.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the request was found within the alloted time. Else returns the
 * errno with remaining time filled in timeout argument.
