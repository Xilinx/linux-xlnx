 * This function will try to evict vmas until a free space satisfying the

 * already before calling this function.
 *
 * This function is used by the object/vma binding code.

 * pinned. Hence obj->pages_pin_count does not protect against eviction.
 *
 * To clarify: This is for freeing up virtual address space, not for freeing
 * memory in e.g. the shrinker.
