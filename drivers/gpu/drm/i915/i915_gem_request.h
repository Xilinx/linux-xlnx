 * emission time to be associated with the request for tracking how far ahead
 * of the GPU the submission is.
 *
 * When modifying this structure be very aware that we perform a lockless
 * RCU lookup of it that may race against reallocation of the struct
 * from the slab freelist. We intentionally do not zero the structure on
 * allocation so that the lookup can use the dangling pointers (and is
 * cogniscent that those pointers may be wrong). Instead, everything that
 * needs to be initialised must be done so explicitly.
 *
 * The requests are reference counted.

/* We treat requests as fences. This is not be to confused with our
 * "fence registers" but pipeline synchronisation objects ala GL_ARB_sync.
 * We use the fences to synchronize access from the CPU with activity on the
 * GPU, for example, we should not rewrite an object's PTE whilst the GPU
 * is reading them. We also track fences at a higher level to provide
 * implicit synchronisation around GEM objects, e.g. set-domain will wait
 * for outstanding GPU rendering before marking the object ready for CPU
 * access, or a pageflip will wait until the GPU is complete before showing
 * the frame on the scanout.
 *
 * In order to use a fence, the object must track the fence it needs to
 * serialise with. For example, GEM objects want to track both read and
 * write access so that we can perform concurrent read operations between
 * the CPU and GPU engines, as well as waiting for all rendering to
 * complete, or waiting for the last GPU user of a "fence register". The
 * object then embeds a #i915_gem_active to track the most recent (in
 * retirement order) request relevant for the desired mode of access.
 * The #i915_gem_active is updated with i915_gem_active_set() to track the
 * most recent fence request, typically this is done as part of
 * i915_vma_move_to_active().
 *
 * When the #i915_gem_active completes (is retired), it will
 * signal its completion to the owner through a callback as well as mark
 * itself as idle (i915_gem_active.request == NULL). The owner
 * can then perform any action, such as delayed freeing of an active
 * resource including itself.
