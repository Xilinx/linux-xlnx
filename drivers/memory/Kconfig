	tristate "Texas Instruments EMIF driver"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	select DDR
	help
	  This driver is for the EMIF module available in Texas Instruments
	  SoCs. EMIF is an SDRAM controller that, based on its revision,
	  supports one or more of DDR2, DDR3, and LPDDR2 SDRAM protocols.
	  This driver takes care of only LPDDR2 memories presently. The
	  functions of the driver includes re-configuring AC timing
	  parameters and other settings during frequency, voltage and
	  temperature changes

config MVEBU_DEVBUS
	bool "Marvell EBU Device Bus Controller"
	default y
	depends on PLAT_ORION && OF
	help
	  This driver is for the Device Bus controller available in some
	  Marvell EBU SoCs such as Discovery (mv78xx0), Orion (88f5xxx) and
	  Armada 370 and Armada XP. This controller allows to handle flash
	  devices such as NOR, NAND, SRAM, and FPGA.

config TEGRA20_MC
	bool "Tegra20 Memory Controller(MC) driver"
	default y
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_2x_SOC
	help
	  This driver is for the Memory Controller(MC) module available
	  in Tegra20 SoCs, mainly for a address translation fault
	  analysis, especially for IOMMU/GART(Graphics Address
	  Relocation Table) module.

config TEGRA30_MC
	bool "Tegra30 Memory Controller(MC) driver"
	default y
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC
	help
	  This driver is for the Memory Controller(MC) module available
	  in Tegra30 SoCs, mainly for a address translation fault
	  analysis, especially for IOMMU/SMMU(System Memory Management
	  Unit) module.

config PL353_SMC
	bool "ARM PL353 Static Memory Controller(SMC) driver"
	default y
	depends on ARM
	help
	  This driver is for the ARM PL353 Static Memory Controller(SMC) module.
