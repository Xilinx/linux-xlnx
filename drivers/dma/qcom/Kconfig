	  Enable support for the QCOM BAM DMA controller.  This controller
	  provides DMA capabilities for a variety of on-chip devices.

	  Enable support for the Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA Management.
	  Each DMA device requires one management interface driver
	  for basic initialization before QCOM_HIDMA channel driver can
	  start managing the channels. In a virtualized environment,
	  the guest OS would run QCOM_HIDMA channel driver and the
	  host would run the QCOM_HIDMA_MGMT management driver.

config QCOM_HIDMA
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA Channel support"
	select DMA_ENGINE
	help
	  Enable support for the Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA controller.
	  The HIDMA controller supports optimized buffer copies
	  (user to kernel, kernel to kernel, etc.).  It only supports
	  memcpy interface. The core is not intended for general
	  purpose slave DMA.
