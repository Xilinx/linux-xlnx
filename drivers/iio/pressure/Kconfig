	  Say yes here to build support for STMicroelectronics pressure
	  sensors: LPS001WP, LPS331AP.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, these modules
	  will be created:
	  - st_pressure (core functions for the driver [it is mandatory]);
	  - st_pressure_i2c (necessary for the I2C devices [optional*]);
	  - st_pressure_spi (necessary for the SPI devices [optional*]);

	  (*) one of these is necessary to do something.
