	  This is a video4linux driver for the Cisco PCIe Cobalt card.

	  This board is sadly not available outside of Cisco, but it is
	  very useful as an example of a real driver that uses all the
	  latest frameworks and APIs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cobalt.
