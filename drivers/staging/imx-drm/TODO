TODO:
- get DRM Maintainer review for this code
- Wait for common display framework to hit mainline and update the IPU
  driver to use it. This will most probably make changes to the devicetree
  bindings necessary.
- Factor out more code to common helper functions
- decide where to put the base driver. It is not specific to a subsystem
  and would be used by DRM/KMS and media/V4L2

Missing features (not necessarily for moving out of staging):

- Add i.MX6 HDMI support
- Add support for IC (Image converter)
- Add support for CSI (CMOS Sensor interface)
- Add support for VDIC (Video Deinterlacer)

Many work-in-progress patches for the above features exist. Contact
Sascha Hauer <kernel@pengutronix.de> if you are interested in working
on a specific feature.

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org> and
