* checkpatch fixes
* remove unnecessary comments
* remove unnecessary error messages. Example kzalloc() has its
  own error message. Adding an extra one is useless.
* use goto statements for error handling when appropriate
* there is a lot of unnecessary code in the driver. It was
  originally a standalone driver. Remove uneeded code.
