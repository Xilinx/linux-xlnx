This driver depends on the CEC framework, which is currently in
staging, so therefor this driver is in staging as well.

In addition, this driver requires that userspace sets the physical
address. However, this should be passed on from the corresponding
samsung HDMI driver. It is very annoying if userspace has to do this,
and other than USB CEC adapters this must be handled automatically.
