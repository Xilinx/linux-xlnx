* Add at least one device driver for a DPAA2 object (child device of the
  fsl-mc bus).  Most likely candidate for this is adding DPAA2 Ethernet
  driver support, which depends on drivers for several objects: DPNI,
  DPIO, DPMAC.  Other pre-requisites include:

     * MC firmware uprev.  The MC firmware upon which the fsl-mc
       bus driver and DPAA2 object drivers are based is continuing
       to evolve, so minor updates are needed to keep in sync with binary
       interface changes to the MC.

* Cleanup
