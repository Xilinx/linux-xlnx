/*
 * The previous block comment is used to automatically generate
 * documentation in Comedi and Comedilib.  The fields:
 *
 *  Driver: the name of the driver
 *  Description: a short phrase describing the driver.  Don't list boards.
 *  Devices: a full list of the boards that attempt to be supported by
 *    the driver.  Format is "(manufacturer) board name [comedi name]",
 *    where comedi_name is the name that is used to configure the board.
 *    See the comment near board_name: in the struct comedi_driver structure
 *    below.  If (manufacturer) or [comedi name] is missing, the previous
 *    value is used.
 *  Author: you
 *  Updated: date when the _documentation_ was last updated.  Use 'date -R'
 *    to get a value for this.
 *  Status: a one-word description of the status.  Valid values are:
 *    works - driver works correctly on most boards supported, and
 *      passes comedi_test.
 *    unknown - unknown.  Usually put there by ds.
 *    experimental - may not work in any particular release.  Author
 *      probably wants assistance testing it.
 *    bitrotten - driver has not been update in a long time, probably
 *      doesn't work, and probably is missing support for significant
 *      Comedi interface features.
 *    untested - author probably wrote it "blind", and is believed to
 *      work, but no confirmation.
 *
 * These headers should be followed by a blank line, and any comments
 * you wish to say about the driver.  The comment area is the place
 * to put any known bugs, limitations, unsupported features, supported
 * command triggers, whether or not commands are supported on particular
 * subdevices, etc.
 *
 * Somewhere in the comment should be information about configuration
 * options that are used with comedi_config.
