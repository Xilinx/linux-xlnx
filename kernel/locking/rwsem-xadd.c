 *		    X = #active readers + # readers attempting lock
 *		    (X*ACTIVE_BIAS + WAITING_BIAS)
 *		(2) 1 writer attempting lock, no waiters for lock
 *		    X-1 = #active readers + #readers attempting lock
 *		    ((X-1)*ACTIVE_BIAS + ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS)
 *		(3) 1 writer active, no waiters for lock
 *		    X-1 = #active readers + #readers attempting lock
 *		    ((X-1)*ACTIVE_BIAS + ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS)
 *
 * 0xffff0001	(1) 1 reader active or attempting lock, waiters for lock
 *		    (WAITING_BIAS + ACTIVE_BIAS)
 *		(2) 1 writer active or attempting lock, no waiters for lock
 *		    (ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS)
 *
 * 0xffff0000	(1) There are writers or readers queued but none active
 *		    or in the process of attempting lock.
 *		    (WAITING_BIAS)
 *		Note: writer can attempt to steal lock for this count by adding
 *		ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS in cmpxchg and checking the old count
 *
 * 0xfffe0001	(1) 1 writer active, or attempting lock. Waiters on queue.
 *		    (ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS + WAITING_BIAS)
 *
 * Note: Readers attempt to lock by adding ACTIVE_BIAS in down_read and checking
 *	 the count becomes more than 0 for successful lock acquisition,
 *	 i.e. the case where there are only readers or nobody has lock.
 *	 (1st and 2nd case above).
 *
 *	 Writers attempt to lock by adding ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS in down_write and
 *	 checking the count becomes ACTIVE_WRITE_BIAS for successful lock
 *	 acquisition (i.e. nobody else has lock or attempts lock).  If
 *	 unsuccessful, in rwsem_down_write_failed, we'll check to see if there
 *	 are only waiters but none active (5th case above), and attempt to
 *	 steal the lock.
