config PREEMPT_NONE
	bool "No Forced Preemption (Server)"
	help
	  This is the traditional Linux preemption model, geared towards
	  throughput. It will still provide good latencies most of the
	  time, but there are no guarantees and occasional longer delays
	  are possible.

	  Select this option if you are building a kernel for a server or
	  scientific/computation system, or if you want to maximize the
	  raw processing power of the kernel, irrespective of scheduling
	  latencies.

config PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY
	bool "Voluntary Kernel Preemption (Desktop)"
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel by adding more
	  "explicit preemption points" to the kernel code. These new
	  preemption points have been selected to reduce the maximum
	  latency of rescheduling, providing faster application reactions,
	  at the cost of slightly lower throughput.

	  This allows reaction to interactive events by allowing a
	  low priority process to voluntarily preempt itself even if it
	  is in kernel mode executing a system call. This allows
	  applications to run more 'smoothly' even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Select this if you are building a kernel for a desktop system.

config PREEMPT__LL
	bool "Preemptible Kernel (Low-Latency Desktop)"
	select PREEMPT
	select UNINLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK if !ARCH_INLINE_SPIN_UNLOCK
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel by making
	  all kernel code (that is not executing in a critical section)
	  preemptible.  This allows reaction to interactive events by
	  permitting a low priority process to be preempted involuntarily
	  even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call and would
	  otherwise not be about to reach a natural preemption point.
	  This allows applications to run more 'smoothly' even when the
	  system is under load, at the cost of slightly lower throughput
	  and a slight runtime overhead to kernel code.

	  Select this if you are building a kernel for a desktop or
	  embedded system with latency requirements in the milliseconds
	  range.

config PREEMPT_RTB
	bool "Preemptible Kernel (Basic RT)"
	select PREEMPT_RT_BASE
	help
	  This option is basically the same as (Low-Latency Desktop) but
	  enables changes which are preliminary for the full preemptible
	  RT kernel.

	bool "Fully Preemptible Kernel (RT)"
	depends on IRQ_FORCED_THREADING
