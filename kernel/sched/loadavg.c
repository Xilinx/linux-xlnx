/*
 * Global load-average calculations
 *
 * We take a distributed and async approach to calculating the global load-avg
 * in order to minimize overhead.
 *
 * The global load average is an exponentially decaying average of nr_running +
 * nr_uninterruptible.
 *
 * Once every LOAD_FREQ:
 *
 *   nr_active = 0;
 *   for_each_possible_cpu(cpu)
 *	nr_active += cpu_of(cpu)->nr_running + cpu_of(cpu)->nr_uninterruptible;
 *
 *   avenrun[n] = avenrun[0] * exp_n + nr_active * (1 - exp_n)
 *
 * Due to a number of reasons the above turns in the mess below:
 *
 *  - for_each_possible_cpu() is prohibitively expensive on machines with
 *    serious number of cpus, therefore we need to take a distributed approach
 *    to calculating nr_active.
 *
 *        \Sum_i x_i(t) = \Sum_i x_i(t) - x_i(t_0) | x_i(t_0) := 0
 *                      = \Sum_i { \Sum_j=1 x_i(t_j) - x_i(t_j-1) }
 *
 *    So assuming nr_active := 0 when we start out -- true per definition, we
 *    can simply take per-cpu deltas and fold those into a global accumulate
 *    to obtain the same result. See calc_load_fold_active().
 *
 *    Furthermore, in order to avoid synchronizing all per-cpu delta folding
 *    across the machine, we assume 10 ticks is sufficient time for every
 *    cpu to have completed this task.
 *
 *    This places an upper-bound on the IRQ-off latency of the machine. Then
 *    again, being late doesn't loose the delta, just wrecks the sample.
 *
 *  - cpu_rq()->nr_uninterruptible isn't accurately tracked per-cpu because
 *    this would add another cross-cpu cacheline miss and atomic operation
 *    to the wakeup path. Instead we increment on whatever cpu the task ran
 *    when it went into uninterruptible state and decrement on whatever cpu
 *    did the wakeup. This means that only the sum of nr_uninterruptible over
 *    all cpus yields the correct result.
 *
 *  This covers the NO_HZ=n code, for extra head-aches, see the comment below.

/*
 * Handle NO_HZ for the global load-average.
 *
 * Since the above described distributed algorithm to compute the global
 * load-average relies on per-cpu sampling from the tick, it is affected by
 * NO_HZ.
 *
 * The basic idea is to fold the nr_active delta into a global idle-delta upon
 * entering NO_HZ state such that we can include this as an 'extra' cpu delta
 * when we read the global state.
 *
 * Obviously reality has to ruin such a delightfully simple scheme:
 *
 *  - When we go NO_HZ idle during the window, we can negate our sample
 *    contribution, causing under-accounting.
 *
 *    We avoid this by keeping two idle-delta counters and flipping them
 *    when the window starts, thus separating old and new NO_HZ load.
 *
 *    The only trick is the slight shift in index flip for read vs write.
 *
 *        0s            5s            10s           15s
 *          +10           +10           +10           +10
 *        |-|-----------|-|-----------|-|-----------|-|
 *    r:0 0 1           1 0           0 1           1 0
 *    w:0 1 1           0 0           1 1           0 0
 *
 *    This ensures we'll fold the old idle contribution in this window while
 *    accumlating the new one.
 *
 *  - When we wake up from NO_HZ idle during the window, we push up our
 *    contribution, since we effectively move our sample point to a known
 *    busy state.
 *
 *    This is solved by pushing the window forward, and thus skipping the
 *    sample, for this cpu (effectively using the idle-delta for this cpu which
 *    was in effect at the time the window opened). This also solves the issue
 *    of having to deal with a cpu having been in NOHZ idle for multiple
 *    LOAD_FREQ intervals.
 *
 * When making the ILB scale, we should try to pull this in as well.
