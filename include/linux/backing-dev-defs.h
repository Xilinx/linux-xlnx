 * On the default hierarchy, blkcg implicitly enables memcg.  This allows
 * using memcg's page ownership for attributing writeback IOs, and every
 * memcg - blkcg combination can be served by its own wb by assigning a
 * dedicated wb to each memcg, which enables isolation across different
 * cgroups and propagation of IO back pressure down from the IO layer upto
 * the tasks which are generating the dirty pages to be written back.
 *
 * A cgroup wb is indexed on its bdi by the ID of the associated memcg,
 * refcounted with the number of inodes attached to it, and pins the memcg
 * and the corresponding blkcg.  As the corresponding blkcg for a memcg may
 * change as blkcg is disabled and enabled higher up in the hierarchy, a wb
 * is tested for blkcg after lookup and removed from index on mismatch so
 * that a new wb for the combination can be created.
