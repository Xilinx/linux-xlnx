README file for the Linux g_NCR5380 driver.

This file documents the NCR53c400 extensions by Kevin Lentin and some
enhancements to the NCR5380 core.

This driver supports both NCR5380 and NCR53c400 cards in port or memory
mapped modes. Currently this driver can only support one of those mapping
modes at a time but it does support both of these chips at the same time.
The next release of this driver will support port & memory mapped cards at
the same time. It should be able to handle multiple different cards in the
same machine.

The drivers/scsi/Makefile has an override in it for the most common
NCR53c400 card, the Trantor T130B in its default configuration:
	Port: 0x350
	IRQ : 5

The NCR53c400 does not support DMA but it does have Pseudo-DMA which is
supported by the driver.

This driver provides some information on what it has detected in
/proc/scsi/g_NCR5380/x where x is the scsi card number as detected at boot
time. More info to come in the future.

This driver works as a module.
When included as a module, parameters can be passed on the insmod/modprobe
command line:
  irq=xx[,...]	the interrupt(s)
  base=xx[,...]	the port or base address(es) (for port or memory mapped, resp.)
  card=xx[,...]	card type(s):
		0 = NCR5380,
		1 = NCR53C400,
		2 = NCR53C400A,
		3 = Domex Technology Corp 3181E (DTC3181E)
		4 = Hewlett Packard C2502

These old-style parameters can support only one card:
  ncr_irq=xx   the interrupt
  ncr_addr=xx  the port or base address (for port or memory
               mapped, resp.)
  ncr_5380=1   to set up for a NCR5380 board
  ncr_53c400=1 to set up for a NCR53C400 board
  ncr_53c400a=1 to set up for a NCR53C400A board
  dtc_3181e=1  to set up for a Domex Technology Corp 3181E board
  hp_c2502=1   to set up for a Hewlett Packard C2502 board

e.g.
OLD: modprobe g_NCR5380 ncr_irq=5 ncr_addr=0x350 ncr_5380=1
NEW: modprobe g_NCR5380 irq=5 base=0x350 card=0
  for a port mapped NCR5380 board or

OLD: modprobe g_NCR5380 ncr_irq=255 ncr_addr=0xc8000 ncr_53c400=1
NEW: modprobe g_NCR5380 irq=255 base=0xc8000 card=1
  for a memory mapped NCR53C400 board with interrupts disabled or

NEW: modprobe g_NCR5380 irq=0,7 base=0x240,0x300 card=3,4
  for two cards: DTC3181 (in non-PnP mode) at 0x240 with no IRQ
             and HP C2502 at 0x300 with IRQ 7

(255 should be specified for no or DMA interrupt, 254 to autoprobe for an 
     IRQ line if overridden on the command line.)
