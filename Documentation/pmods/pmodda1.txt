Description
-----------

The Digilent PmodDA1 Digital To Analog Module Converter Board (the DA1) converts
signals from digital to analog at up to one MSa per second.

The Digilent PmodDA1 relies on two Analog Devices AD7303, thus implementing four
simultaneous D/A conversion channels, each with an 8-bit converter that can
process a separate digital signal.

The PmodDA1 converts an 8 bit digital value to an analog output
ranging from 0-3.3 volts.

This Linux driver is based on SPI. Because SPI can not write on Data Out line of
SPI, only the 2 channels corresponding to the first AD7303 (the channels corresponding
to A1 and B1 pins of J2 connector of PmodDA1) can be accessed using this driver.

The driver is implemented as a character driver. Corresponding to each channel,
two separates nodes are created by the driver code, having different minor numbers.

The basic action of the driver is write, when 8 bits data is outputted to each of the
two channels. Still, read function is also implemented, by providing the last written
value.

The Reference Manual for PmodDA1 device is available online at

SDIN       SPI Data Out (MOSI)
SCLK       SPI Clock
SS	   Slave Select


Devicetree
----------

Required Properties:
- compatible : Should be "dlgnt,pmodda1"
- spi-bus-num :  Should specify the bus number for PmodDA1 SPI controller.
  This value cannot be shared by any other SPI controller present in the
  device tree.
- spi-sclk-gpio :  Should specify the GPIO for SCLK, see "gpios property" in
  Documentation/devicetree/gpio.txt.
- spi-sdin-gpio :  Should specify the GPIO for SDIN, see "gpios property" in
  Documentation/devicetree/gpio.txt.

Optional Properties:
- spi-cs-gpio :  Should specify the GPIO for CS, see "gpios property" in
  Documentation/devicetree/gpio.txt. If unspecified, CS is assumed to be
  tied to ground.
- spi-speed-hz : Should specify the spi speed (in Hz). If unspecified, spi
  speed is assumed to be 625000 (625 kHz).

Examples:

		pmodda1 {
			compatible = "dglnt,pmodda1";
			spi-bus-num = <0x4>;
			spi-speed-hz = <625000>;
			spi-sclk-gpio = <0x8 85 0>;
			spi-sdin-gpio = <0x8 83 0>;
			spi-cs-gpio = <0x8 82 0>;
		};


Configuration
-------------

The PmodDA1 is located in the kernel configuration menu at
Device Drivers -> Pmods -> PmodDA1. The driver can be built into the kernel
by selecting (*) for it, or loadable module by selecting (M) for it.


Device Nodes
------------

Two char device nodes are created for each PmodDA1 device automatically,
having 0 and 1 as minor numbers.

The name of the nodes is by default the one declared in the device tree,
postfixed with "_0" (for channel A1) and "_1" (for channel B1).


Writing to the device
-----------
Characters written to the device are used as 8 bits values sent to the appropriate
converter channel. While writing to a channel the other channel is not disabled,
allowing it to perform its current task.


Reading from the device
-----------
The PmodDA1 is a "write only" device. Still, the driver implements a shadow register
that also maintains the last value written to the converter. When read occurs, this
value is used to fill the read buffer.


Example of commands
-----------

- Write 0x80 value to second channel (B1) of the device
echo -n -e "\x80" > /dev/pmodda1_1

- Read (repeatedly) first channel (A1) of the device
hexdump -C -v /dev/pmodda1_0
