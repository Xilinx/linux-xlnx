Description
-----------

LTC2990 is a Quad I2C Voltage, Current and Temperature Monitor.
The chip's inputs can measure 4 voltages, or two inputs together (1+2 and 3+4)
can be combined to measure a differential voltage, which is typically used to
measure current through a series resistor, or a temperature.

This driver currently uses the 2x differential mode only. In order to support
other modes, the driver will need to be expanded.


Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for PMBus devices. You will have to instantiate
devices explicitly.


Sysfs attributes
----------------

The "curr*_input" measurements actually report the voltage drop across the
input pins in microvolts. This is equivalent to the current through a 1mOhm
sense resistor. Divide the reported value by the actual sense resistor value
in mOhm to get the actual value.

in0_input     Voltage at Vcc pin in millivolt (range 2.5V to 5V)
temp1_input   Internal chip temperature in millidegrees Celcius
curr1_input   Current in mA across v1-v2 assuming a 1mOhm sense resistor.
curr2_input   Current in mA across v3-v4 assuming a 1mOhm sense resistor.
