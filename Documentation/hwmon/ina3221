Description
-----------

The Texas Instruments INA3221 monitors voltage, current, and power on the high
side of up to three D.C. power supplies. The INA3221 monitors both shunt drop
and supply voltage, with programmable conversion times and averaging, current
and power are calculated host-side from these.
