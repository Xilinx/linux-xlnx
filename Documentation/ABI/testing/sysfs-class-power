Date:		May 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	Daniel Mack <daniel@caiaq.de>
Description:
		This file is writeable and can be used to set the current
		coloumb counter value inside the battery monitor chip. This
		is needed for unavoidable corrections of aging batteries.
		A userspace daemon can monitor the battery charging logic
		and once the counter drops out of considerable bounds, take
		appropriate action.

Date:		May 2010
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	Daniel Mack <daniel@caiaq.de>
Description:
		This file is writeable and can be used to set the assumed
		battery 'full level'. As batteries age, this value has to be
		amended over time.

What:		/sys/class/power_supply/max14577-charger/device/fast_charge_timer
Date:		October 2014
KernelVersion:	3.18.0
Contact:	Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>
Description:
		This entry shows and sets the maximum time the max14577
		charger operates in fast-charge mode. When the timer expires
		the device will terminate fast-charge mode (charging current
		will drop to 0 A) and will trigger interrupt.

		Valid values:
		- 5, 6 or 7 (hours),
		- 0: disabled.

Contact:	Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>
Description:
		This entry shows and sets the maximum time the max77693
		charger operates in fast-charge mode. When the timer expires
		the device will terminate fast-charge mode (charging current
		will drop to 0 A) and will trigger interrupt.

		Valid values:
		- 4 - 16 (hours), step by 2 (rounded down)
		- 0: disabled.

Date:		January 2015
KernelVersion:	3.19.0
Contact:	Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>
Description:
		This entry shows and sets the charging current threshold for
		entering top-off charging mode. When charging current in fast
		charge mode drops below this value, the charger will trigger
		interrupt and start top-off charging mode.

		Valid values:
		- 100000 - 200000 (microamps), step by 25000 (rounded down)
		- 200000 - 350000 (microamps), step by 50000 (rounded down)
		- 0: disabled.

Description:
		This entry shows and sets the maximum time the max77693
		charger operates in top-off charge mode. When the timer expires

What:		/sys/class/power_supply/bq24257-charger/ovp_voltage
Date:		October 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4.0
Contact:	Andreas Dannenberg <dannenberg@ti.com>
Description:
		This entry configures the overvoltage protection feature of bq24257-
		type charger devices. This feature protects the device and other
		components against damage from overvoltage on the input supply. See
		device datasheet for details.

		Valid values:
		- 6000000, 6500000, 7000000, 8000000, 9000000, 9500000, 10000000,
		  10500000 (all uV)

What:		/sys/class/power_supply/bq24257-charger/in_dpm_voltage
Date:		October 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4.0
Contact:	Andreas Dannenberg <dannenberg@ti.com>
Description:
		This entry configures the input dynamic power path management voltage of
		bq24257-type charger devices. Once the supply drops to the configured
		voltage, the input current limit is reduced down to prevent the further
		drop of the supply. When the IC enters this mode, the charge current is
		lower than the set value. See device datasheet for details.

		Valid values:
		- 4200000, 4280000, 4360000, 4440000, 4520000, 4600000, 4680000,

Date:		October 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4.0
Contact:	Andreas Dannenberg <dannenberg@ti.com>
Description:
		This entry allows enabling the high-impedance mode of bq24257-type
		charger devices. If enabled, it places the charger IC into low power
		standby mode with the switch mode controller disabled. When disabled,
		the charger operates normally. See device datasheet for details.

		Valid values:
		- 1: enabled
		- 0: disabled

What:		/sys/class/power_supply/bq24257-charger/sysoff_enable
Date:		October 2015
KernelVersion:	4.4.0
Contact:	Andreas Dannenberg <dannenberg@ti.com>
Description:
		This entry allows enabling the sysoff mode of bq24257-type charger
		devices. If enabled and the input is removed, the internal battery FET
		is turned off in order to reduce the leakage from the BAT pin to less
		than 1uA. Note that on some devices/systems this disconnects the battery
		from the system. See device datasheet for details.

		Valid values:
		- 1: enabled
		- 0: disabled
