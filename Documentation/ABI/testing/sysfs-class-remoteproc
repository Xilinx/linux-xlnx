Description:	Remote processor state

		Reports the state of the remote processor, which will be one of:

		"offline"
		"suspended"
		"running"
		"crashed"
		"invalid"

		"offline" means the remote processor is powered off.

		"suspended" means that the remote processor is suspended and
		must be woken to receive messages.

		"running" is the normal state of an available remote processor

		"crashed" indicates that a problem/crash has been detected on
		the remote processor.

		"invalid" is returned if the remote processor is in an
		unknown state.

		Writing this file controls the state of the remote processor.
		The following states can be written:

		"start"
		"stop"

		Writing "start" will attempt to start the processor running the
		firmware indicated by, or written to,
		/sys/class/remoteproc/.../firmware. The remote processor should
		transition to "running" state.

		Writing "stop" will attempt to halt the remote processor and
		return it to the "offline" state.
