Description:	Name of low level fpga manager driver.

Description:	Read fpga manager state as a string.
		The intent is to provide enough detail that if something goes
		wrong during FPGA programming (something that the driver can't
		fix) then userspace can know, i.e. if the firmware request
		fails, that could be due to not being able to find the firmware
		file.

		This is a superset of FPGA states and fpga manager driver
		states.  The fpga manager driver is walking through these steps
		to get the FPGA into a known operating state.  It's a sequence,
		though some steps may get skipped.  Valid FPGA states will vary
		by manufacturer; this is a superset.

		* unknown		= can't determine state
		* power off		= FPGA power is off
		* power up		= FPGA reports power is up
		* reset			= FPGA held in reset state
		* firmware request	= firmware class request in progress
		* firmware request error = firmware request failed
		* write init		= preparing FPGA for programming
		* write init error	= Error while preparing FPGA for
					  programming
		* write			= FPGA ready to receive image data
		* write error		= Error while programming
		* write complete	= Doing post programming steps
		* write complete error	= Error while doing post programming
		* operating		= FPGA is programmed and operating
