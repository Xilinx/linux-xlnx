Description:
                Defines the interval in milliseconds in which batman
                emits probing packets for neighbor sensing (ELP).

Description:
                The /sys/class/net/<iface>/batman-adv/mesh_iface file
                displays the batman mesh interface this <iface>
                currently is associated with.

Contact:        Antonio Quartulli <a@unstable.cc>
description:
                Defines the throughput value to be used by B.A.T.M.A.N. V
                when estimating the link throughput using this interface.
                If the value is set to 0 then batman-adv will try to
                estimate the throughput by itself.
