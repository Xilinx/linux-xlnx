V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV21
Formats with Â½ horizontal and vertical chroma resolution, also known as
YUV 4:2:0. One luminance and one chrominance plane with alternating
chroma samples as opposed to ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_YVU420``


Description
===========

These are two-plane versions of the YUV 4:2:0 format. The three
components are separated into two sub-images or planes. The Y plane is
first. The Y plane has one byte per pixel. For ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12``, a
combined CbCr plane immediately follows the Y plane in memory. The CbCr
plane is the same width, in bytes, as the Y plane (and of the image),
but is half as tall in pixels. Each CbCr pair belongs to four pixels.
For example, Cb\ :sub:`0`/Cr\ :sub:`0` belongs to Y'\ :sub:`00`,
Y'\ :sub:`01`, Y'\ :sub:`10`, Y'\ :sub:`11`. ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV21`` is
the same except the Cb and Cr bytes are swapped, the CrCb plane starts
with a Cr byte.

If the Y plane has pad bytes after each row, then the CbCr plane has as
many pad bytes after its rows.

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is one byte.
