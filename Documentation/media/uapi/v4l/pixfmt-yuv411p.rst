*****************************
V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV411P ('411P')
*****************************


Format with ¼ horizontal chroma resolution, also known as YUV 4:1:1.
Planar layout as opposed to ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_Y41P``


Description
===========

This format is not commonly used. This is a planar format similar to the
4:2:2 planar format except with half as many chroma. The three
components are separated into three sub-images or planes. The Y plane is
first. The Y plane has one byte per pixel. The Cb plane immediately
follows the Y plane in memory. The Cb plane is ¼ the width of the Y
plane (and of the image). Each Cb belongs to 4 pixels all on the same
row. For example, Cb\ :sub:`0` belongs to Y'\ :sub:`00`, Y'\ :sub:`01`,
Y'\ :sub:`02` and Y'\ :sub:`03`. Following the Cb plane is the Cr plane,
just like the Cb plane.

If the Y plane has pad bytes after each row, then the Cr and Cb planes
have ¼ as many pad bytes after their rows. In other words, four C x rows
(including padding) is exactly as long as one Y row (including padding).

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is one byte.
