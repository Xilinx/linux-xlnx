V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV410
Planar formats with ¼ horizontal and vertical chroma resolution, also
known as YUV 4:1:0


Description
===========

These are planar formats, as opposed to a packed format. The three
components are separated into three sub-images or planes. The Y plane is
first. The Y plane has one byte per pixel. For ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_YVU410``,
the Cr plane immediately follows the Y plane in memory. The Cr plane is
¼ the width and ¼ the height of the Y plane (and of the image). Each Cr
belongs to 16 pixels, a four-by-four square of the image. Following the
Cr plane is the Cb plane, just like the Cr plane.
``V4L2_PIX_FMT_YUV410`` is the same, except the Cb plane comes first,
then the Cr plane.

If the Y plane has pad bytes after each row, then the Cr and Cb planes
have ¼ as many pad bytes after their rows. In other words, four Cx rows
(including padding) are exactly as long as one Y row (including
padding).

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is one byte.
