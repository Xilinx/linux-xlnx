V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV21M
V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12MT_16X16
Variation of ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12`` and ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV21`` with planes
non contiguous in memory.


Description
===========

This is a multi-planar, two-plane version of the YUV 4:2:0 format. The
three components are separated into two sub-images or planes.
``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M`` differs from ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12`` in that the
two planes are non-contiguous in memory, i.e. the chroma plane do not
necessarily immediately follows the luma plane. The luminance data
occupies the first plane. The Y plane has one byte per pixel. In the
second plane there is a chrominance data with alternating chroma
samples. The CbCr plane is the same width, in bytes, as the Y plane (and
of the image), but is half as tall in pixels. Each CbCr pair belongs to
four pixels. For example, Cb\ :sub:`0`/Cr\ :sub:`0` belongs to
Y'\ :sub:`00`, Y'\ :sub:`01`, Y'\ :sub:`10`, Y'\ :sub:`11`.
``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12MT_16X16`` is the tiled version of
``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M`` with 16x16 macroblock tiles. Here pixels are
arranged in 16x16 2D tiles and tiles are arranged in linear order in
memory. ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV21M`` is the same as ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M``
except the Cb and Cr bytes are swapped, the CrCb plane starts with a Cr
byte.

``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12M`` is intended to be used only in drivers and
applications that support the multi-planar API, described in
:ref:`planar-apis`.

If the Y plane has pad bytes after each row, then the CbCr plane has as
many pad bytes after its rows.

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is one byte.
