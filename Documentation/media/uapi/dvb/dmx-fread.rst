Name

DVB demux read()


Synopsis
--------

.. c:function:: size_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)
    :name: dvb-dmx-read

Arguments
---------

``fd``
  File descriptor returned by a previous call to :c:func:`open() <dvb-ca-open>`.

 ``buf``
   Buffer to be filled

``count``
   Max number of bytes to read

Description
-----------

This system call returns filtered data, which might be section or PES
data. The filtered data is transferred from the driverâ€™s internal
circular buffer to buf. The maximum amount of data to be transferred is
implied by count.

Return Value
------------

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{2.5cm}|p{15.0cm}|

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0


    -  .. row 1

       -  ``EWOULDBLOCK``

       -  No data to return and O_NONBLOCK was specified.

       -  fd is not a valid open file descriptor.

    -  .. row 3

       -  ``ECRC``

       -

    -  .. row 5

       -
       -  The filtered data was not read from the buffer in due time,
	  resulting in non-read data being lost. The buffer is flushed.

    -  .. row 6

       -  ``ETIMEDOUT``

       -  The section was not loaded within the stated timeout period. See
	  ioctl DMX_SET_FILTER for how to set a timeout.

       -  ``EFAULT``

       -  The driver failed to write to the callers buffer due to an invalid
	  \*buf pointer.
