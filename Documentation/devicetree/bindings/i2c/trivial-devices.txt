This is a list of trivial i2c devices that have simple device tree
bindings, consisting only of a compatible field, an address and
possibly an interrupt line.

If a device needs more specific bindings, such as properties to
describe some aspect of it, there needs to be a specific binding
document for it just like any other devices.
