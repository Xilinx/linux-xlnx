* Texas Instruments Davinci/Keystone I2C

This file provides information, what the device node for the
davinci/keystone i2c interface contains.

Required properties:
- compatible: "ti,davinci-i2c" or "ti,keystone-i2c";
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

Recommended properties :
- interrupts : standard interrupt property.
- clock-frequency : desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
- ti,has-pfunc: boolean; if defined, it indicates that SoC supports PFUNC
	registers. PFUNC registers allow to switch I2C pins to function as
	GPIOs, so they can by toggled manually.

Example (enbw_cmc board):
	i2c@1c22000 {
		compatible = "ti,davinci-i2c";
		reg = <0x22000 0x1000>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		interrupts = <15>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		dtt@48 {
			compatible = "national,lm75";
			reg = <0x48>;
		};
	};
