Binding for the Cadence I2C controller

Required properties:
  - reg: Physical base address and size of the controller's register area.
  - compatible: Should contain one of:
		* "cdns,i2c-r1p10"
		Note:	Use this when cadence i2c controller version 1.0 is used.
		* "cdns,i2c-r1p14"
		Note:	Use this when cadence i2c controller version 1.4 is used.
  - clocks: Input clock specifier. Refer to common clock bindings.
  - interrupts: Interrupt specifier. Refer to interrupt bindings.
  - #address-cells: Should be 1.
  - #size-cells: Should be 0.

Optional properties:
  - clock-frequency: Desired operating frequency, in Hz, of the bus.
  - clock-names: Input clock name, should be 'pclk'.

Example:
	i2c@e0004000 {
		compatible = "cdns,i2c-r1p10";
		clocks = <&clkc 38>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 25 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		reg = <0xe0004000 0x1000>;
		clock-frequency = <400000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
