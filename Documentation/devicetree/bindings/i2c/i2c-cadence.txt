Binding for the Cadence I2C controller

Required properties:
  compatible: Compatibility string. Must be 'cdns,i2c-r1p10'.
  clocks: From common clock bindings. Phandle to input clock.

Optional properties:
  clock-frequency: Desired operating frequency, in Hz, of the bus (actual may
		   be lower). Defaults to 400000 if not specified.

Example:

	i2c0: cdns-i2c@e0004000 {
		compatible = "cdns,i2c-r1p10";
		clocks = <&clkc 38>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <0 25 4>;
		reg = <0xE0004000 0x1000>;
		clock-frequency = <400000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
