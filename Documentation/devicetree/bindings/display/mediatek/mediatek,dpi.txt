Mediatek DPI Device
===================

The Mediatek DPI function block is a sink of the display subsystem and
provides 8-bit RGB/YUV444 or 8/10/10-bit YUV422 pixel data on a parallel
output bus.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,<chip>-dpi"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the function block.
- clocks: device clocks
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: must contain "pixel", "engine", and "pll"
- port: Output port node with endpoint definitions as described in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. This port should be connected
  to the input port of an attached HDMI or LVDS encoder chip.

Example:

dpi0: dpi@1401d000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-dpi";
	reg = <0 0x1401d000 0 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 194 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
	clocks = <&mmsys CLK_MM_DPI_PIXEL>,
		 <&mmsys CLK_MM_DPI_ENGINE>,
		 <&apmixedsys CLK_APMIXED_TVDPLL>;
	clock-names = "pixel", "engine", "pll";

	port {
		dpi0_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&hdmi0_in>;
		};
	};
};
