Device-Tree bindings for Xilinx MIPI DSI Tx IP core

The IP core supports transmission of video data in MIPI DSI protocol.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "xlnx,dsi".

 - reg: Base address and size of the IP core.

 - xlnx,dsi-datatype: Color format. The value should be one of "MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB888",
  "MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB666", "MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB666_PACKED" or "MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB565".

 - simple_panel: The subnode for connected panel. This represents the
   DSI peripheral connected to the DSI host node. Please refer to
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/mipi-dsi-bus.txt. The
   simple-panel driver has auo,b101uan01 panel timing parameters added along
   with other existing panels. DSI driver derive the required Tx IP controller
   timing values from the panel timing parameters.

 - port: Logical block can be used / connected independently with
   external device. In the display controller port nodes, topology
   for entire pipeline should be described using the DT bindings defined in
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

 - xlnx,dsi-num-lanes: Possible number of DSI lanes for the Tx controller.
   The values should be 1, 2, 3 or 4. Based on xlnx,dsi-num-lanes and
   line rate for the MIPI D-PHY core in Mbps, the AXI4-stream received by
   Xilinx MIPI DSI Tx IP core adds markers as per DSI protocol and the packet
   thus framed is convered to serial data by MIPI D-PHY core. Please refer
   Xilinx pg238 for more details. This value should be equal to the number
   of lanes supported by the connected DSI panel. Panel has to support this
   value or has to be programmed to the same value that DSI Tx controller is
   configured to.

Required simple_panel properties:
 - compatible: Value should be one of the panel names in
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/. e.g. "auo,b101uan01".
   For available panel compatible strings, please refer to bindings in
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/

Optional properties:
 - xlnx,vpss: vpss phandle
   This handle is required only when VPSS is connected to DSI as bridge.

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/drm/mipi-dsi.h>
	mipi_dsi_tx_subsystem@80000000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,dsi";
		reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x10000>;
		xlnx,dsi-num-lanes = <4>;
		xlnx,dsi-data-type = <MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB888>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		xlnx,vpss = <&v_proc_ss_0>;
		encoder_dsi_port: port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			dsi_encoder: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&xyz_port>;
			};
		};
		simple_panel: simple-panel@0 {
			compatible = "auo,b101uan01";
			reg = <0>;
			};
		};
