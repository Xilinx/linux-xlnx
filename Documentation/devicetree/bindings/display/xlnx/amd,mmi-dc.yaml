title: AMD Multimedia Integrated Display Controller.

description:
  The AMD Multimedia Integrated Display Controller IP block implements the
  AV pipelines in the Versal Gen 2 family of devices.

  The Display Controller works in 2 modes Functional and Bypass.

  In Bypass mode, up to 4 video streams (including audio and SDP data) from the PL
  can be passed on directly to the UDH Display Port Tx IP. Max resolution supported
  in this case is 8kp30 (quad pixel per clock).

  In functional mode, 2 video streams are blended and passed on to the UDH DP Tx
  and to the PL out / feedback path. Here there can be only one of the video streams
  can have an audio stream. The video streams can come from non live / memory path
  or from the PL fabric input. There are 3 modes here namely -
  1. Non-live - Both video streams, one audio stream and one cursor / SDP stream
  are from memory. The pixel clock comes from internal clock.
  2. Live mode - Both video streams, audio stream originate from PL
  3. Mixed mode - One video stream is from memory and another is from PL.
  The video clock in this case comes from the PL fabric video.
  Max resolution supported is 4kp60.
