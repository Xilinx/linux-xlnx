STMicroelectronics STM32 HW RNG
===============================

The STM32 hardware random number generator is a simple fixed purpose IP and
is fully separated from other crypto functions.

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "st,stm32-rng"
- reg : Should be register base and length as documented in the datasheet
- interrupts : The designated IRQ line for the RNG
- clocks : The clock needed to enable the RNG

Example:

	rng: rng@50060800 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-rng";
		reg = <0x50060800 0x400>;
		interrupts = <80>;
		clocks = <&rcc 0 38>;
	};
