max98926 audio CODEC

This device supports I2C.

Required properties:

  - compatible : "maxim,max98926"

  - vmon-slot-no : slot number used to send voltage information
                   or in inteleave mode this will be used as
                   interleave slot.

  - imon-slot-no : slot number used to send current information

  - interleave-mode : When using two MAX98926 in a system it is
                      possible to create ADC data that that will
                      overflow the frame size. Digital Audio Interleave
                      mode provides a means to output VMON and IMON data
                      from two devices on a single DOUT line when running
                      smaller frames sizes such as 32 BCLKS per LRCLK or
                      48 BCLKS per LRCLK.

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

Example:

codec: max98926@1a {
   compatible = "maxim,max98926";
   vmon-slot-no = <0>;
   imon-slot-no = <2>;
   reg = <0x1a>;
};
