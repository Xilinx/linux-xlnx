* Dialog DA9062 Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC)

DA9062 consists of a large and varied group of sub-devices:

Device                   Supply Names    Description
------                   ------------    -----------
da9062-regulator        :               : LDOs & BUCKs
da9062-rtc              :               : Real-Time Clock
da9062-watchdog         :               : Watchdog Timer

======

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "dlg,da9062".
- reg : Specifies the I2C slave address (this defaults to 0x58 but it can be
  modified to match the chip's OTP settings).
- interrupt-parent : Specifies the reference to the interrupt controller for
  the DA9062.
- interrupts : IRQ line information.
- interrupt-controller

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for
further information on IRQ bindings.

Sub-nodes:

- regulators : This node defines the settings for the LDOs and BUCKs. The
  DA9062 regulators are bound using their names listed below:

    buck1    : BUCK_1
    buck2    : BUCK_2
    buck3    : BUCK_3
    buck4    : BUCK_4
    ldo1     : LDO_1
    ldo2     : LDO_2
    ldo3     : LDO_3
    ldo4     : LDO_4

  The component follows the standard regulator framework and the bindings
  details of individual regulator device can be found in:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt


- rtc : This node defines settings required for the Real-Time Clock associated
  with the DA9062. There are currently no entries in this binding, however
  compatible = "dlg,da9062-rtc" should be added if a node is created.

- watchdog: This node defines the settings for the watchdog driver associated
  with the DA9062 PMIC. The compatible = "dlg,da9062-watchdog" should be added
  if a node is created.


Example:

	pmic0: da9062@58 {
		compatible = "dlg,da9062";
		reg = <0x58>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio6>;
		interrupts = <11 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		interrupt-controller;

		rtc {
			compatible = "dlg,da9062-rtc";
		};

		watchdog {
			compatible = "dlg,da9062-watchdog";
		};

		regulators {
			DA9062_BUCK1: buck1 {
				regulator-name = "BUCK1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <300000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1570000>;
				regulator-min-microamp = <500000>;
				regulator-max-microamp = <2000000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
			DA9062_LDO1: ldo1 {
				regulator-name = "LDO_1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3600000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
		};
	};
