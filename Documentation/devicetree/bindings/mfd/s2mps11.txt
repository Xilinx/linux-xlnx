* Samsung S2MPS11 Voltage and Current Regulator

The Samsung S2MPS11 is a multi-function device which includes voltage and
current regulators, RTC, charger controller and other sub-blocks. It is
interfaced to the host controller using an I2C interface. Each sub-block is
addressed by the host system using different I2C slave addresses.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "samsung,s2mps11-pmic".
- reg: Specifies the I2C slave address of the pmic block. It should be 0x66.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: Specifies the phandle of the interrupt controller to which
  the interrupts from s2mps11 are delivered to.
- interrupts: Interrupt specifiers for interrupt sources.

Optional nodes:
- clocks: s2mps11 provides three(AP/CP/BT) buffered 32.768 KHz outputs, so to
  register these as clocks with common clock framework instantiate a sub-node
  named "clocks". It uses the common clock binding documented in :
  [Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt]
  - #clock-cells: should be 1.

  - The following is the list of clocks generated by the controller. Each clock
    is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier to specify
    the clock which they consume.
    Clock               ID
    ----------------------
    32KhzAP		0
    32KhzCP		1
    32KhzBT		2

- regulators: The regulators of s2mps11 that have to be instantiated should be
included in a sub-node named 'regulators'. Regulator nodes included in this
sub-node should be of the format as listed below.

	regulator_name {
		[standard regulator constraints....];
	};

 regulator-ramp-delay for BUCKs = [6250/12500/25000(default)/50000] uV/us

 BUCK[2/3/4/6] supports disabling ramp delay on hardware, so explictly
 regulator-ramp-delay = <0> can be used for them to disable ramp delay.
 In the absence of the regulator-ramp-delay property, the default ramp
 delay will be used.

NOTE: Some BUCKs share the ramp rate setting i.e. same ramp value will be set
for a particular group of BUCKs. So provide same regulator-ramp-delay<value>.
Grouping of BUCKs sharing ramp rate setting is as follow : BUCK[1, 6],
BUCK[3, 4], and BUCK[7, 8, 10]

The regulator constraints inside the regulator nodes use the standard regulator
bindings which are documented elsewhere.

The following are the names of the regulators that the s2mps11 pmic block
supports. Note: The 'n' in LDOn and BUCKn represents the LDO or BUCK number
as per the datasheet of s2mps11.

	- LDOn
		  - valid values for n are 1 to 38
		  - Example: LDO0, LD01, LDO28
	- BUCKn
		  - valid values for n are 1 to 10.
		  - Example: BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK9

Example:

	s2mps11_pmic@66 {
		compatible = "samsung,s2mps11-pmic";
		reg = <0x66>;

		s2m_osc: clocks{
			#clock-cells = 1;
			clock-output-names = "xx", "yy", "zz";
		};

		regulators {
			ldo1_reg: LDO1 {
				regulator-name = "VDD_ABB_3.3V";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
			};

			ldo2_reg: LDO2 {
				regulator-name = "VDD_ALIVE_1.1V";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1100000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1100000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};

			buck1_reg: BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_mif";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <950000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1350000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};

			buck2_reg: BUCK2 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_arm";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <950000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1350000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
				regulator-ramp-delay = <50000>;
