* Real Time Clock of the i.MX SoCs

RTC controller for the i.MX SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx1-rtc" or "fsl,imx21-rtc".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: IRQ line for the RTC.
- clocks: should contain two entries:
  * one for the input reference
  * one for the the SoC RTC
- clock-names: should contain:
  * "ref" for the input reference clock
  * "ipg" for the SoC RTC clock

Example:

rtc@10007000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx21-rtc";
	reg = <0x10007000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <22>;
	clocks = <&clks IMX27_CLK_CKIL>,
		 <&clks IMX27_CLK_RTC_IPG_GATE>;
	clock-names = "ref", "ipg";
};
