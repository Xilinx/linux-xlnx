Zynq EDAC driver, it does reports the DDR ECC single bit errors that are
corrected and double bit ecc errors that are detected by the DDR ECC controller.
ECC support for DDR is available in half-bus width(16 bit) configuration only.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "xlnx,zynq-ddrc-1.0"
- reg: Should contain DDR controller registers location and length.

Example:
++++++++

zynq_ddrc_0: zynq-ddrc@f8006000 {
	compatible = "xlnx,zynq-ddrc-1.0";
	reg = <0xf8006000 0x1000>;
};

Zynq EDAC driver detects the DDR ECC enable state by reading the appropriate
control register.
