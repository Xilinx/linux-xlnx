* Analog Devices ADV7604/11 video decoder with HDMI receiver

The ADV7604 and ADV7611 are multiformat video decoders with an integrated HDMI
receiver. The ADV7604 has four multiplexed HDMI inputs and one analog input,
and the ADV7611 has one HDMI input and no analog input.

Required Properties:

  - compatible: Must contain one of the following
    - "adi,adv7604" for the ADV7604
    - "adi,adv7611" for the ADV7611

  - reg: I2C slave address

  - hpd-gpios: References to the GPIOs that control the HDMI hot-plug
    detection pins, one per HDMI input. The active flag indicates the GPIO
    level that enables hot-plug detection.

Optional Properties:

  - reset-gpios: Reference to the GPIO connected to the device's reset pin.

  - adi,default-input: Index of the input to be configured as default. Valid
    values are 0..5 for the ADV7604 and 0 for the ADV7611.

  - adi,disable-power-down: Boolean property. When set forces the device to
    ignore the power-down pin. The property is valid for the ADV7604 only as
    the ADV7611 has no power-down pin.

  - adi,disable-cable-reset: Boolean property. When set disables the HDMI
    receiver automatic reset when the HDMI cable is unplugged.

Example:

	hdmi_receiver@4c {
		compatible = "adi,adv7611";
		reg = <0x4c>;

		reset-gpios = <&ioexp 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		hpd-gpios = <&ioexp 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

		adi,default-input = <0>;

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			hdmi_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&ccdc_in>;
			};
		};
	};
