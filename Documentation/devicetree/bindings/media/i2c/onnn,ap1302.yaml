description: |-
  The AP1302 is a standalone ISP for ON Semiconductor sensors. It interfaces to
  up to two RAW CMOS sensors over MIPI CSI-2 connections, processes the two
  video streams and outputs YUV frames to the host over a MIPI CSI-2 interface.
  Frames are output side by side or on two virtual channels.

  The sensors must be identical. They are connected to the AP1302 on dedicated
  I2C buses, and are controlled by the AP1302 firmware. They are not accessible
  from the host.
