Xilinx Video Gamma Correction IP
-----------------------------------
The Xilinx Video Gamma Correction IP is used to provide RGB gamma correction.
The IP provides a look up table for each R,G and B components.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,v-gamma-lut".

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- clocks: Reference to the clock that drives the ap_clk
	  signal of Video Gamma Lookup.

- reset-gpios: Specifier for a GPIO that asserts Gamma IP (AP_RST_N) reset

- ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The Gamma LUT IP has an input port (0) and an output port (1).


Required port properties:
- reg: This value represents the media pad of the V4L2 sub-device.
  A Sink Pad is represented by reg = <0>
  A Source Pad is represented by reg = <1>

- xlnx,video-width: Video width as defined in video.txt. Can be either 8 or 10.

Example :

	gamma_lut_1: gamma_lut_1@0xa0080000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-gamma-lut";
		reg = <0x0 0xa0080000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&vid_stream_clk>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 83 1>;
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				gamma_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&demosaic_out>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				gamma_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&csc_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
