Xilinx MIPI CSI2 Receiver Subsystem (CSI2RxSS)
----------------------------------------------

The Xilinx MIPI CSI2 Receiver Subsystem is used to capture MIPI CSI2 traffic
from compliant camera sensors and send the output as AXI4 Stream video data
for image processing. The subsystem consists of a MIPI DPHY in slave mode
which captures the data packets. This is passed along the MIPI CSI2 IP which
extracts the packet data. This data is taken in by the Video Format Bridge
(VFB) if selected and converted into AXI4 Stream video data at selected
pixels per clock as per AXI4-Stream Video IP and System Design UG934.

For more details, please refer to PG232 MIPI CSI-2 Receiver Subsystem v2.0

Required properties:

- compatible: Must contain "xlnx,mipi-csi2-rx-subsystem-2.0"

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- xlnx,max-lanes: Maximum active lanes in the design.

- xlnx,en-active-lanes: Enable Active lanes configuration in Protocol
  Configuration Register.

- xlnx,dphy-present: This is equivalent to whether DPHY register interface is
  enabled or not.

- xlnx,iic-present: This shows whether subsystem's IIC is present or not. This
  affects the base address of the DPHY.

- xlnx,vc: Virtual Channel, specifies virtual channel number to be filtered.
  If this is 4 then all virtual channels are allowed.

- xlnx,csi-pxl-format: This denotes the CSI Data type selected in hw design.
  Packets other than this data type (except for RAW8 and User defined data
  types) will be filtered out. Possible values are RAW6, RAW7, RAW8, RAW10,
  RAW12, RAW14, RGB444, RGB555, RGB565, RGB666, RGB888 and YUV4228bit.

- xlnx,vfb: Video Format Bridge, Denotes if Video Format Bridge is selected
  so that output is as per AXI stream documented in UG934.

- xlnx,ppc: Pixels per clock, Number of pixels to be transferred per pixel
  clock. This is valid only if xlnx,vfb property is set to 1.

- xlnx,axis-tdata-width: AXI Stream width, This denotes the AXI Stream width.
  It depends on Data type chosen, Video Format Bridge enabled/disabled and
  pixels per clock. If VFB is disabled then its value is either 0x20 (32 bit)
  or 0x40(64 bit) width.

- xlnx,video-format, xlnx,video-width: Video format and width, as defined in
  video.txt.

- port: Video port, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The CSI 2 Rx Subsystem has a two ports, one input port for connecting to
  camera sensor and other is output port.

- data-lanes: The number of data lanes through which CSI2 Rx Subsystem is
  connected to the camera sensor as per video-interfaces.txt

Example:

	csiss_1: csiss@a0020000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,mipi-csi2-rx-subsystem-2.0";

		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 95 4>;

		reset-gpios = <&gpio 81 1>;
		xlnx,max-lanes = <0x4>;
		xlnx,en-active-lanes;
		xlnx,dphy-present;
		xlnx,iic-present;
		xlnx,vc = <0x4>;
		xlnx,csi-pxl-format = "RAW8";
		xlnx,vfb;
		xlnx,ppc = <0x4>;
		xlnx,axis-tdata-width = <0x20>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;

				xlnx,video-format = <XVIP_VF_YUV_422>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;
				csiss_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&vcap_csiss_in>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;

				xlnx,video-format = <XVIP_VF_YUV_422>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				csiss_in: endpoint {
					data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
					/* MIPI CSI2 Camera handle */
					remote-endpoint = <&vs2016_out>;
				};

			};

		};
