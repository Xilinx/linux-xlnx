Xilinx SDI Receiver Subsystem
------------------------------

The Xilinx SDI Rx Subsystem is used to capture SDI Video in upto 12G mode.
It outputs the video as an AXI4 Stream video data in YUV 422 10bpc mode.
The subsystem consists of the SDI Rx IP whose SDI native output is connected
to a SDI to Native conversion Bridge. The output of the Native bridge is
connected to a Native to AXI4S Bridge which generates the AXI4 Stream of
YUV422 or YUV420 10 bpc in dual pixel per clock.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must contain "xlnx,v-smpte-uhdsdi-rx-ss"

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- interrupts: Contains the interrupt line number.

- interrupt-parent: phandle to interrupt controller.

- xlnx,include-edh: Whether the EDH processor is enabled in design or not.

- xlnx,line-rate: The maximum mode supported by the design.

- clocks: Input clock specifier. Refer to common clock bindings.

- clock-names: List of input clocks.
  Required elements: "s_axi_aclk", "sdi_rx_clk", "video_out_clk"

- port: Video port, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The SDI Rx subsystem has one port configured as output port.

- xlnx,video-format, xlnx,video-width: Video format and width, as defined in
  video.txt. Please note that the video format is fixed to either YUV422 or YUV420
  and the video-width is 10.

Example:
		v_smpte_uhdsdi_rx_ss: v_smpte_uhdsdi_rx_ss@80000000 {
			compatible = "xlnx,v-smpte-uhdsdi-rx-ss";
			interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
			interrupts = <0 89 4>;
			reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x10000>;
			xlnx,include-axilite = "true";
			xlnx,include-edh = "true";
			xlnx,include-vid-over-axi = "true";
			xlnx,line-rate = "12G_SDI_8DS";
			clocks = <&clk_1>, <&si570_1>, <&clk_2>;
			clock-names = "s_axi_aclk", "sdi_rx_clk", "video_out_clk";

			ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				port@0 {
					reg = <0>;

					xlnx,video-format = <XVIP_VF_YUV_422>;
					xlnx,video-width = <10>;

					sdirx_out: endpoint {
						remote-endpoint = <&vcap_sdirx_in>;
					};
				};
			};
		};
