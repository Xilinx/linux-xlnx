Xilinx HLS Video Demosaic IP
------------------------------------------------
The Xilinx HLS Video Demosaic IP is used to interface to a Bayer source.
It can convert 8-bit Bayer formats to 24 bit RGB format. Currently, the
driver supports only the following configurations :
	- 8 bit, High Quality Interpolation
	- No zipper

The driver comes in RGGB as default Sink Pad media bus format.
It can be changed through media-ctl user utility. The IP and driver
only support RGB as its Source Pad media format.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,v-demosaic-v1.0".

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- clocks: Reference to the video core clock.

- reset-gpios: Specifier for a GPIO that assert Demosaic IP (AP_RST_N) reset.

- ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The scaler has an input port (0) and an output port (1).


Required port properties:

- reg: This value represents the media pad of the V4L2 sub-device.
  A Sink Pad is represented by reg = <0>
  A Source Pad is represented by reg = <1>

- xlnx,video-width: Video width as defined in video.txt

Example :
	demosaic_1: demosaic@0xA00B0000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-demosaic-v1.0";
		reg = <0x0 0xa00b0000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&vid_stream_clk>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 87 1>;
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				demosaic_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&tpg_out>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				demosaic_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&gamma_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
