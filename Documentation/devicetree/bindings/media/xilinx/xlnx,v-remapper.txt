Xilinx Video Remapper
---------------------

The IP core remaps input pixel components to produce an output pixel with
less, more or the same number of components as the input pixel.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,v-remapper".

- clocks: Reference to the video core clock.

- xlnx,video-width: Video pixel component width, as defined in video.txt.

- #xlnx,s-components: Number of components per pixel at the input port
  (between 1 and 4 inclusive).

- #xlnx,m-components: Number of components per pixel at the output port
  (between 1 and 4 inclusive).

- xlnx,component-maps: Remapping configuration represented as an array of
  integers. The array contains one entry per output component, in the low to
  high order. Each entry corresponds to the zero-based position of the
  corresponding input component, or the value 4 to drive a constant value on
  the output component. For example, to remap RGB to BGR use <2 1 0>, and to
  remap RBG to xRGB use <1 0 2 4>.

- ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The remapper as an input port (0) and and output port (1).

Example: RBG to xRGB remapper

	remapper_0: remapper {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-remapper";

		clocks = <&clkc 15>;

		xlnx,video-width = <8>;

		#xlnx,s-components = <3>;
		#xlnx,m-components = <4>;
		xlnx,component-maps = <1 0 2 4>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				remap0_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&tpg0_out>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				remap0_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&sobel0_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
