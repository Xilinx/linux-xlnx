Xilinx Video Demosaic IP
-----------------------------
The Xilinx Video Demosaic IP is used to interface to a Bayer video source.

The driver set default Sink Pad media bus format to RGGB.
The IP and driver only support RGB as its Source Pad media format.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,v-demosaic".

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- clocks: Reference to the AXI Streaming clock feeding the Demosaic ap_clk.

- reset-gpios: Specifier for GPIO that asserts Demosaic IP (AP_RST_N) reset.

- ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.

Required port properties:

- reg: This value represents the media pad of the V4L2 sub-device.
  A Sink Pad is represented by reg = <0>
  A Source Pad is represented by reg = <1>

- xlnx,video-width: Video width as defined in video.txt

Example :
	demosaic_1: demosaic@a00b0000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-demosaic";
		reg = <0x0 0xa00b0000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&vid_stream_clk>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 87 1>;
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				demosaic_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&tpg_out>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				demosaic_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&gamma_in>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
