Xilinx HDMI RX Subsystem

The Xilinx HDMI RX Subsystem contains several subcores to implement
a HDMI receiver. /hdmi/xilinx-hdmi-rx.c implements a
V4L2 video-capture sub-device for the Xilinx Video IP Pipeline device
(xilinx-vipp).

There are 2 optional HDCP cores that can be included in the IP configuration.
Below provided sample device tree depicts the configuration when both cores are 
included. If an optional core is included then corresponding entries for the 
core parameters (interrupts, key-management block address) must be included in
the device tree

Note: If HDCP cores are included in the design, the user must provide valid
	  HDCP keys for the encryption to work. 

Refer to xlnx,vphy.txt for the phy specifics.

Required Properties:
 - compatible: Should be "xlnx,v-hdmi-rx-ss-3.0".
 - reg: Base address and size of the IP core and hdcp1x key management block
 - reg-names: Identification string for included register blocks
		"hdmi-rxss": Identification string for hdmirx subsystem. Always present
		"hdcp1x-keymngmt": Identification string for Key management block for
			hdcp1x. [Optional]
 - interrupts-parent: phandle for interrupt controller.
 - interrupts: Interrupt numbers for mandatory and optional blocks
 - interrupt-names: Identification string that binds irq number to block 
		generating the interrupt
		"hdmirx": interrupt for rx subcore [always present]
		"hdcp1x": interrupt for hdcp1.4 core [optional]
		"hdcp1x-timer": interrupt for hdcp1.4 timer [present if hdcp1x is 
			included]
		"hdcp22": interrupt for hdcp22 core [optional]
		"hdcp22-timer": interrupt for hdcp2.2 timer [present if hdcp22 is
			included]
		
 - clocks: phandle for axi-lite, video stream
 - clock-names: The identification string, "axi-lite", is always required for
                the axi-lite clock, "video" is always required for video stream
				clock
   
 - phys: phandle for phy lanes registered for hdmi protocol. HDMI always 
         require 3 lanes
 - phy-names: The identification string, "hdmi-phy0" and so on
 
 - xlnx,input-pixels-per-clock: IP configuration for samples/clk (2, 4)
         Note: Only 2 is supported at this time
 - xlnx,edid-ram-size: Denotes amount of BRAM allocated for EDID in IP 
 - xlnx,include-hdcp-1-4: Boolean parameter that denotes if hdcp14 is included.
		If present indicates inclusion of the optional core
 - xlnx,include-hdcp-2-2: Boolean parameter that denotes if hdcp22 is included.
		If present indicates inclusion of the optional core
 - ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
          The Rx only has an output port (0).
 
==Example==
If hdcp1.4 is included in the design then key management block node should be
added to the device tree
