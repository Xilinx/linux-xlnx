Aspeed Vectored Interrupt Controller

These bindings are for the Aspeed AST2400 interrupt controller register layout.
The SoC has an legacy register layout, but this driver does not support that
mode of operation.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "aspeed,ast2400-vic".

- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value shall be 1.

Example:

 vic: interrupt-controller@1e6c0080 {
      compatible = "aspeed,ast2400-vic";
      interrupt-controller;
      #interrupt-cells = <1>;
      reg = <0x1e6c0080 0x80>;
 };
