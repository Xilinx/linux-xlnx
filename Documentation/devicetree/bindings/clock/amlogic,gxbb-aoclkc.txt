* Amlogic GXBB AO Clock and Reset Unit

The Amlogic GXBB AO clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
controllers within the Always-On part of the SoC.

Required Properties:

- compatible: should be "amlogic,gxbb-aoclkc"
- reg: physical base address of the clock controller and length of memory
       mapped region.

- #clock-cells: should be 1.

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/gxbb-aoclkc.h header and can be
used in device tree sources.

- #reset-cells: should be 1.

Each reset is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the reset which they consume. All available resets are defined as
preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/reset/gxbb-aoclkc.h header and can be
used in device tree sources.

Example: AO Clock controller node:

	clkc_AO: clock-controller@040 {
		compatible = "amlogic,gxbb-aoclkc";
		reg = <0x0 0x040 0x0 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};

Example: UART controller node that consumes the clock and reset generated
  by the clock controller:

	uart_AO: serial@4c0 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-uart";
		reg = <0x4c0 0x14>;
		interrupts = <0 90 1>;
		clocks = <&clkc_AO CLKID_AO_UART1>;
		resets = <&clkc_AO RESET_AO_UART1>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
