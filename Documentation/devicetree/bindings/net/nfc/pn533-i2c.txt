* NXP Semiconductors PN532 NFC Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nxp,pn532-i2c" or "nxp,pn533-i2c".
- clock-frequency: IÂ²C work frequency.
- reg: address on the bus
- interrupt-parent: phandle for the interrupt gpio controller
- interrupts: GPIO interrupt to which the chip is connected

Optional SoC Specific Properties:
- pinctrl-names: Contains only one value - "default".
- pintctrl-0: Specifies the pin control groups used for this controller.

Example (for ARM-based BeagleBone with PN532 on I2C2):

&i2c2 {

	status = "okay";

	pn532: pn532@24 {

		compatible = "nxp,pn532-i2c";

		reg = <0x24>;
		clock-frequency = <400000>;

		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <17 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;

	};
};
