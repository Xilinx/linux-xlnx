XILINX AXI ETHERNET Device Tree Bindings
--------------------------------------------------------

This driver supports following MAC configurations-
a) AXI 1G/2.5G Ethernet Subsystem.
b) 10G/25G High Speed Ethernet Subsystem.
c) 10 Gigabit Ethernet Subsystem.
d) USXGMII Ethernet Subsystem.

AXI 1G/2.5G Ethernet Subsystem- also called  AXI 1G/2.5G Ethernet Subsystem,
the xilinx axi ethernet IP core provides connectivity to an external ethernet
PHY supporting different interfaces: MII, GMII, RGMII, SGMII, 1000BaseX.
It also includes two segments of memory for buffering TX and RX, as well as
the capability of offloading TX/RX checksum calculation off the processor.

Management configuration is done through the AXI interface, while payload is
sent and received through means of an AXI DMA controller. This driver
includes the DMA driver code, so this driver is incompatible with AXI DMA
driver.

For details about MDIO please refer phy.txt [1].

Required properties:
- compatible	: Must be one of "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.00.a" or
		  "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.01.a" or "xlnx,axi-ethernet-2.01.a"
		  for 1G MAC,
		  "xlnx,ten-gig-eth-mac" for 10 Gigabit Ethernet Subsystem,
		  "xlnx,xxv-ethernet-1.0" for 10G/25G MAC,
		  "xlnx,axi-2_5-gig-ethernet-1.0" for 2.5G MAC and
		  "xlnx,xxv-usxgmii-ethernet-1.0" for USXGMII.
- reg		: Address and length of the IO space, as well as the address
                  and length of the AXI DMA controller IO space, unless
                  axistream-connected is specified, in which case the reg
                  attribute of the node referenced by it is used.
- interrupts	: Should be a list of 2 or 3 interrupts: TX DMA, RX DMA,
		  and optionally Ethernet core.
- phy-handle	: Should point to the external phy device.
		  See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- xlnx,rxmem	: Set to allocated memory buffer for Rx/Tx in the hardware

Optional properties:
- phy-mode	: See ethernet.txt
- xlnx,phy-type	: Deprecated, do not use, but still accepted in preference
		  to phy-mode.
- xlnx,txcsum	: 0 or empty for disabling TX checksum offload,
		  1 to enable partial TX checksum offload,
		  2 to enable full TX checksum offload
- xlnx,rxcsum	: Same values as xlnx,txcsum but for RX checksum offload
- clocks		: Input clock specifier. Refer to common clock bindings.
- clock-names		: Input clock names. Refer to IP PG for signal description.
			  1G/2.5G: s_axi_lite_clk, axis_clk and ref_clk.
			  10G/25G and USXGMII: s_axi_aclk, rx_core_clk and dclk.
			  10 Gigabit: s_axi_aclk and dclk.
			  AXI DMA and MCDMA: m_axi_sg_aclk, m_axi_mm2s_aclk and
			  m_axi_s2mm_aclk.
 - mdio		: Child node for MDIO bus. Must be defined if PHY access is
		  required through the core's MDIO interface (i.e. always,
		  unless the PHY is accessed through a different bus).
- dma-coherent		: Present if dma operations are coherent.
- xlnx,eth-hasnobuf	: Used when 1G MAC is configured in non-processor mode.
- xlnx,rxtsfifo		: Configures the axi fifo for receive timestamping.

Optional properties for connected DMA node:
- xlnx,addrwidth	: Specify the width of the DMA address space in bits.
			  Value type is u8. Valid range is 32-64. Default is 32.
- xlnx,include-dre	: Tells whether DMA h/w is configured with data
			  realignment engine(DRE) or not.

Optional properties (When USXGMII is in use):
- xlnx,usxgmii-rate	: USXGMII PHY speed - can be 10, 100, 1000, 2500,
			  5000 or 10000.

NOTE: Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) related DT bindings are explained in [4].
