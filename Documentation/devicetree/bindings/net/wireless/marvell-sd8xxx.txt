Marvell 8897/8997 (sd8897/sd8997) SDIO devices
------

This node provides properties for controlling the marvell sdio wireless device.
The node is expected to be specified as a child node to the SDIO controller that
connects the device to the system.

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be one of the following:
	* "marvell,sd8897"
	* "marvell,sd8997"

Optional properties:

  - marvell,caldata* : A series of properties with marvell,caldata prefix,
		      represent calibration data downloaded to the device during
		      initialization. This is an array of unsigned 8-bit values.
		      the properties should follow below property name and
		      corresponding array length:
	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-2g" (length = 566).
	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub0" (length = 502).
	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub1" (length = 688).
	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub2" (length = 750).
	"marvell,caldata-txpwrlimit-5g-sub3" (length = 502).
  - marvell,wakeup-pin : a wakeup pin number of wifi chip which will be configured
		      to firmware. Firmware will wakeup the host using this pin
		      during suspend/resume.
  - interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller
  - interrupts : interrupt pin number to the cpu. driver will request an irq based on
		 this interrupt number. during system suspend, the irq will be enabled
		 so that the wifi chip can wakeup host platform under certain condition.
		 during system resume, the irq will be disabled to make sure
		 unnecessary interrupt is not received.

Example:

Tx power limit calibration data is configured in below example.
The calibration data is an array of unsigned values, the length
can vary between hw versions.
IRQ pin 38 is used as system wakeup source interrupt. wakeup pin 3 is configured
so that firmware can wakeup host using this device side pin.

&mmc3 {
	status = "okay";
	vmmc-supply = <&wlan_en_reg>;
	bus-width = <4>;
	cap-power-off-card;
	keep-power-in-suspend;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	mwifiex: wifi@1 {
		compatible = "marvell,sd8897";
		reg = <1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
		interrupts = <38 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

		marvell,caldata_00_txpwrlimit_2g_cfg_set = /bits/ 8 <
	0x01 0x00 0x06 0x00 0x08 0x02 0x89 0x01>;
		marvell,wakeup-pin = <3>;
	};
};
