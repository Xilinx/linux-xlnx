synopsys DWC3 CORE

DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER. Complies to the generic USB binding properties
      as described in 'usb/generic.txt'

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "snps,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.

Optional properties:
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device.  The first element
   in the array is expected to be a handle to the USB2/HS PHY and
   the second element is expected to be a handle to the USB3/SS PHY
 - phys: from the *Generic PHY* bindings
 - phy-names: from the *Generic PHY* bindings; supported names are "usb2-phy"
	or "usb3-phy".
 - snps,usb3_lpm_capable: determines if platform is USB3 LPM capable
 - snps,disable_scramble_quirk: true when SW should disable data scrambling.
	Only really useful for FPGA builds.
 - snps,has-lpm-erratum: true when DWC3 was configured with LPM Erratum enabled
 - snps,lpm-nyet-threshold: LPM NYET threshold
 - snps,u2exit_lfps_quirk: set if we want to enable u2exit lfps quirk
 - snps,u2ss_inp3_quirk: set if we enable P3 OK for U2/SS Inactive quirk
 - snps,req_p1p2p3_quirk: when set, the core will always request for
			P1/P2/P3 transition sequence.
 - snps,del_p1p2p3_quirk: when set core will delay P1/P2/P3 until a certain
			amount of 8B10B errors occur.
 - snps,del_phy_power_chg_quirk: when set core will delay PHY power change
			from P0 to P1/P2/P3.
 - snps,lfps_filter_quirk: when set core will filter LFPS reception.
 - snps,rx_detect_poll_quirk: when set core will disable a 400us delay to start
			Polling LFPS after RX.Detect.
 - snps,tx_de_emphasis_quirk: when set core will set Tx de-emphasis value.
 - snps,tx_de_emphasis: the value driven to the PHY is controlled by the
			LTSSM during USB3 Compliance mode.
 - snps,dis_u3_susphy_quirk: when set core will disable USB3 suspend phy.
 - snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk: when set core will disable USB2 suspend phy.
 - snps,dis_enblslpm_quirk: when set clears the enblslpm in GUSB2PHYCFG,
			disabling the suspend signal to the PHY.
 - snps,dis_rxdet_inp3_quirk: when set core will disable receiver detection
			in PHY P3 power state.
 - snps,dis-u2-freeclk-exists-quirk: when set, clear the u2_freeclk_exists
			in GUSB2PHYCFG, specify that USB2 PHY doesn't provide
			a free-running PHY clock.
 - snps,dis-del-phy-power-chg-quirk: when set core will change PHY power
			from P0 to P1/P2/P3 without delay.
 - snps,is-utmi-l1-suspend: true when DWC3 asserts output signal
			utmi_l1_suspend_n, false when asserts utmi_sleep_n
 - snps,hird-threshold: HIRD threshold
 - snps,hsphy_interface: High-Speed PHY interface selection between "utmi" for
   UTMI+ and "ulpi" for ULPI when the DWC_USB3_HSPHY_INTERFACE has value 3.
 - snps,quirk-frame-length-adjustment: Value for GFLADJ_30MHZ field of GFLADJ
	register for post-silicon frame length adjustment when the
	fladj_30mhz_sdbnd signal is invalid or incorrect.
 - snps,enable_guctl1_resume_quirk: Adding this flag sets bit 10 of GUCTL1
	thus enabling the workaround in HW to fix the issue where the controller
	was not able to generate correct CRC checksum on the very first transfer
	packet after sending resume signal.
 - snps,enable_guctl1_ipd_quirk: Adding this flag sets bit 9 of GUCTL1
	enabling the workaround in HW to reduce the Inter Packet Delay (IPD)
	and making controller enumerate FS/LS devices connected behind VIA-LAB.
 - snps,xhci-stream-quirk: Dwc3 host controller has a bug where it sometimes
	fails to process the traansfer descriptors present in the BULK IN
	stream ring. Since the controller is not processing any TD, no transfer
	events will be triggered, resulting in a hang condition. Enabling this
	flag in dts fixes the above said issue.

 - <DEPRECATED> tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.

This is usually a subnode to DWC3 glue to which it is connected.
