USB PHY

OMAP USB2 PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ti,omap-usb2"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device.
 - #phy-cells: determine the number of cells that should be given in the
   phandle while referencing this phy.

Optional properties:
 - ctrl-module : phandle of the control module used by PHY driver to power on
   the PHY.

This is usually a subnode of ocp2scp to which it is connected.

usb2phy@4a0ad080 {
	compatible = "ti,omap-usb2";
	reg = <0x4a0ad080 0x58>;
	ctrl-module = <&omap_control_usb>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
};

OMAP USB3 PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ti,omap-usb3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device.
 - reg-names: The names of the register addresses corresponding to the registers
   filled in "reg".
 - #phy-cells: determine the number of cells that should be given in the
   phandle while referencing this phy.

Optional properties:
 - ctrl-module : phandle of the control module used by PHY driver to power on
   the PHY.

This is usually a subnode of ocp2scp to which it is connected.

	      <0x4a084800 0x64>,
	      <0x4a084c00 0x40>;
	reg-names = "phy_rx", "phy_tx", "pll_ctrl";
	ctrl-module = <&omap_control_usb>;
	#phy-cells = <0>;
};
