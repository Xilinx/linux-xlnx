Generic Serial DT Bindings

This document lists a set of generic properties for describing UARTs in a
device tree.  Whether these properties apply to a particular device depends on
the DT bindings for the actual device.

Optional properties:
  - cts-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be
    used as the UART's CTS line.
  - dcd-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be
    used as the UART's DCD line.
  - dsr-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be
    used as the UART's DSR line.
  - dtr-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be
    used as the UART's DTR line.
  - rng-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be
    used as the UART's RNG line.
  - rts-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin to be
    used as the UART's RTS line.

  - uart-has-rtscts: The presence of this property indicates that the
    UART has dedicated lines for RTS/CTS hardware flow control, and that
    they are available for use (wired and enabled by pinmux configuration).
    This depends on both the UART hardware and the board wiring.
    Note that this property is mutually-exclusive with "cts-gpios" and
    "rts-gpios" above.
