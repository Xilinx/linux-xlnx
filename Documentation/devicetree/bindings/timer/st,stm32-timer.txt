. STMicroelectronics STM32 timer

The STM32 MCUs family has several general-purpose 16 and 32 bits timers.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "st,stm32-timer"
- reg : Address and length of the register set
- clocks : Reference on the timer input clock
- interrupts : Reference to the timer interrupt

Optional properties:
- resets: Reference to a reset controller asserting the timer

Example:

timer5: timer@40000c00 {
	compatible = "st,stm32-timer";
	reg = <0x40000c00 0x400>;
	interrupts = <50>;
	resets = <&rrc 259>;
	clocks = <&clk_pmtr1>;
};
