* TI Highspeed MMC host controller for OMAP

The Highspeed MMC Host Controller on TI OMAP family
provides an interface for MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties used by the omap_hsmmc driver.

Required properties:
- compatible:
 Should be "ti,omap2-hsmmc", for OMAP2 controllers
 Should be "ti,omap3-hsmmc", for OMAP3 controllers
 Should be "ti,omap4-hsmmc", for OMAP4 controllers
- ti,hwmods: Must be "mmc<n>", n is controller instance starting 1

Optional properties:
ti,dual-volt: boolean, supports dual voltage cards
<supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
"supply-name" examples are "vmmc", "vmmc_aux" etc
ti,non-removable: non-removable slot (like eMMC)
ti,needs-special-reset: Requires a special softreset sequence
ti,needs-special-hs-handling: HSMMC IP needs special setting for handling High Speed
dmas: List of DMA specifiers with the controller specific format
as described in the generic DMA client binding. A tx and rx
specifier is required.
dma-names: List of DMA request names. These strings correspond
1:1 with the DMA specifiers listed in dmas. The string naming is
to be "rx" and "tx" for RX and TX DMA requests, respectively.

Examples:

[hwmod populated DMA resources]

	mmc1: mmc@0x4809c000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-hsmmc";
		reg = <0x4809c000 0x400>;
		ti,hwmods = "mmc1";
		ti,dual-volt;
		bus-width = <4>;
		vmmc-supply = <&vmmc>; /* phandle to regulator node */
		ti,non-removable;
	};

[generic DMA request binding]

	mmc1: mmc@0x4809c000 {
		compatible = "ti,omap4-hsmmc";
		reg = <0x4809c000 0x400>;
		ti,hwmods = "mmc1";
		ti,dual-volt;
		bus-width = <4>;
		vmmc-supply = <&vmmc>; /* phandle to regulator node */
		ti,non-removable;
		dmas = <&edma 24
			&edma 25>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
