* Rockchip specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Rockchip specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "rockchip,rk2928-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK2928 and following,
							before RK3288
	- "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3288
	- "rockchip,rk3036-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3036
	- "rockchip,rk3368-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3368
	- "rockchip,rk3399-dw-mshc", "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3399

Optional Properties:
* clocks: from common clock binding: if ciu_drive and ciu_sample are
  specified in clock-names, should contain handles to these clocks.

* clock-names: Apart from the clock-names described in synopsys-dw-mshc.txt
  two more clocks "ciu-drive" and "ciu-sample" are supported. They are used
  to control the clock phases, "ciu-sample" is required for tuning high-
  speed modes.

* rockchip,default-sample-phase: The default phase to set ciu_sample at
  probing, low speeds or in case where all phases work at tuning time.
  If not specified 0 deg will be used.

Example:

	rkdwmmc0@12200000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x12200000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 75 0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
