* Atmel SDHCI controller

This file documents the differences between the core properties in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt and the properties used by the
sdhci-of-at91 driver.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "atmel,sama5d2-sdhci".
- clocks:		Phandlers to the clocks.
- clock-names:		Must be "hclock", "multclk", "baseclk";


Example:

sdmmc0: sdio-host@a0000000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-sdhci";
	reg = <0xa0000000 0x300>;
	interrupts = <31 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH 0>;
	clocks = <&sdmmc0_hclk>, <&sdmmc0_gclk>, <&main>;
	clock-names = "hclock", "multclk", "baseclk";
};
