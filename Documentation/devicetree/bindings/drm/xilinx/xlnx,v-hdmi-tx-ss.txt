Xilinx HDMI TX Subsystem (Staging)

The Xilinx HDMI TX Subsystem contains several subcores to implement
a HDMI receiver. staging/xilinx/hdmi/xilinx_drm_hdmi.c implements a
DRM/KMS driver that slaves to xilinx_drm_drv.c in the output pipeline.

If xlnx,vtc-offset is given it specifies the offset of the built-in
VTC IP block. This is required.

Refer to xlnx,vphy.txt for the phy specifics.

retimer-clk is optional. If specified, the corresponding driver
should offer a CCF clock that supports .set_rate(). Through this,
the device can retime/redrive the HDMI TX signal on the connector
depending on the TX clock line rate.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "xlnx,v-hdmi-tx-ss-2.0".
 - reg: Base address and size of the IP core.
 - interrupts: Interrupt number.
 - interrupts-parent: phandle for interrupt controller.
 - tx_refclk_rdy_en-gpios: Specifier for a GPIO that is used to over-ride PHY
   tx_refclk_rdy signal from si5324. Polarity should be set to ACTIVE_HIGH (0)

 - clocks: phandle for axi-lite, video stream and retimer clock
 - clock-names: The identification string, "axi-lite", is always required for
                the axi-lite clock, "video" is always required for video stream
				clock and "retimer-clk" is required only when retimer is being 
				used 
   
 - phys: phandle for phy lanes registered for hdmi protocol. HDMI always 
         require 3 lanes
 - phy-names: The identification string, "hdmi-phy0" and so on
 - xlnx,input-pixels-per-clock: IP configuration for samples/clk (1, 2, 4)
         Note: Only 2 is supported at this time
 - xlnx,max-bits-per-component: The data width per video component (8,10,12,16)
         Note: Only 8 is supported at this time
 - xlnx,output-fmt: Output Streaming format. Valid strings are "rgb", 
         "yuv444", "yuv422" and "yuv420"
 - xlnx,hdmi-tx-offset: Relative offset of tx core within the subsystem
 - xlnx,vtc-offset: Relative offset of vtc core within the subsystem
 
The "retimer-clk" is optional. If present, it is notified of TX link
clock changes through set_rate(). Tested with dp159.c driver.
