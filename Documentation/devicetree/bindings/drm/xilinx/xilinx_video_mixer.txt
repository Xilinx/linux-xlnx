Device Tree Bindings for Xilinx Video Mixer IP core

Required properties for Core IP Node:

    Required General Properties:
    - compatible: "xlnx,video_mixer-1.00.a"

    - reg: MMIO base address and size of the Xilinx Video Mixer IP core address
           space

    - interrupts-parent: Phandle for interrupt controller

    - interrupts: Interrupt number

    Required Mixer IP Core Properties
    - xlnx,bpc [number]: The data width per video component (8,10,12,16) Note:
	only 8 is supported at this time

    - xlnx,num-layers [number]: Number of active layers supported (1-8)
	(count does NOT include logo layer but does include base layer)

    - xlnx,ppc [number]: Required if any overlay layers will be utilizing
	a memory-based interface.  The value should represent the number of
	pixels-per-clock being processed by the mixer.

    Optional Mixer IP Core Properties:
    - xlnx,logo-layer: Boolean indicating that logo layer is enabled

Layer Sub Node Properties:
    The device tree will need to include a sub node for each enabled layer
    in the IP core that is to be utilized by the driver.
    These layer nodes describe the base layer as well as each overlay layer
    but not the logo layer (see Logo Layer Properties below).
    Each layer node should be named using "layer_#" format (e.g.
	layer_0 { }; layer_1 {}; ...)

    Required Properties:
    - xlnx,layer-id [number]: Mixer layer number; should correspond to layer
	number in the IP (e.g.  layer_1 should use xlnx,layer_id = <1).  Node
	Layer_0 is the only required node (exception: if xlnx,logo-layer
	property exists, then a logo {}; node must be present).  Layer_0 will
	be interpreted as the background layer and must use layer-id = <0>.

    - xlnx,vformat [string]: Describes the DMA memory format for a layer.

	The proper choice will depend on how each mixer hardware layer is
	configured in the Xilinx Vivado IP Integrator (IPI) tool and, if
	a streaming layer, what format is produced on the bus by the
	connected DMA.

	Layers in the mixer can receive data either as a video stream
	or can use the mixer's built-in dma capabilities.  The choice
	is fixed to use either streaming or dma in the hardware design
	and must be known to choose the correct video format string in
	the device tree for a given layer node.  The list of possible
	choices, depending on the hardware configuration, are listed in
	the table below:

	Interface Type	| IPI Video Format |  xlnx,vformat value
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	  Streaming	|  RGB		   | various (see note below)
	  Streaming	|  YUV 4:4:4	   | various (see note below)
	  Streaming	|  YUV 4:2:2	   | various (see note below)
	  Streaming	|  YUV 4:2:0	   | Supported in future version
			|		   |
	  Memory	|  RGB8		   | "bgr888"
	  Memory	|  YUV8		   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  RGBX8	   | "xbgr8888"
	  Memory	|  YUVX8	   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  YUYV8	   | "yuv422"
	  Memory	|  RGBA8	   | "abgr8888"
	  Memory	|  BGRA8	   | "argb8888"
	  Memory	|  YUVA8	   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  RGBX10	   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  YUVX10	   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  RGB565	   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  Y_UV8	   | "nv16"
	  Memory	|  Y_UV8_420	   | "nv12"
	  Memory	|  Y_UV10	   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  Y_UV10_420	   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  Y8		   | Supported in future version
	  Memory	|  Y10		   | Supported in future version

	Each video format string in the device tree will map to a DRM fourcc code.
	This is how user space will be instructed to format the memory buffer for
	a given mixer layer.  It is important to ensure that the correct value
	for video format be chosen for a given layer depending on its interface
	type.  For "memory" type layers, the xlnx,vformat value indicated in the
	table above is required (e.g. Y_UV8 in your mixer IP design must use "nv16"
	as the value of the layer xlnx,vformat property).  For "streaming"
	layers, however, what is important to know is how the data will be
	provided on the media bus to the mixer by the connected DMA. A streaming
	layer specified as "RGB" expects any dma to provide data on the media
	bus in that format.  You are free to indicate any of the driver
	understood xlnx,vformat values listed in the table below for a
	streaming layer if, and only if, the dma IP connected to the streaming
	layer is capable of reading video data in that memory format and
	providing it to the mixer layer according to its media bus setting.

	The table below indicates the mapping between the device tree
	xlnx,vformat codes and the corresponding code which will be communicated
	to user space applications that interact with the DRM driver.

	xlnx,vformat value | Corresponding DRM fourcc code
	--------------------------------------------------
	  "bgr888"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_BGR888
	  "rgb888"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_RGB888 **
	  "bgr565"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_BGR565 *
	  "yuv422"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_YUYV
	  "ayuv"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_AYUV *
	  "nv12"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_NV12
	  "nv16"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_NV16
	  "rgba8888"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_RGBA8888 **
	  "abgr8888"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_ABGR8888
	  "argb8888"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_ARGB8888
	  "xbgr8888"	   |  DRM_FORMAT_XBGR8888

	* not yet supported in driver
	** native formats for mixer logo layer (depending on whether per-pixel
	   transparency is enabled)

    - xlnx,layer-height [number]: Only required for layer_0 node (master layer).
	Indicates maximum vertical size of active screen display in pixels

    Optional Properties:
    - xlnx,layer-alpha: Indicates that this layer supports global alpha blending

    - xlnx,layer-scale: Indicates that this layer supports mixer scaling. Not
	applicable to layer_0 (i.e. master) node.

    - xlnx,layer-width [number]: Required if xlnx,layer-scale property exists
	for layer.  Indicates maximum number of columns (before scaling) for
	this layer (i.e. horizontal pixels)

    - xlnx,layer-streaming: Layer obtains data as video stream. If omitted,
	layer is presumed to be memory mapped if it is an overlay layer.  If
	omitted for layer_0 (background layer), then the background layer will
	be disabled and generate only a solid background color (typically blue).


Logo Layer Sub Node Properties:
    This node is only required if the core IP node contains the
    'xlnx,logo-layer' property indicating the the core supports a logo layer.
    This subnode should be labled "logo" (e.g. logo { }; ).

    Required Properties:
    - xlnx,layer-id [number]: This should be set to <8>.

    - xlnx,logo-height [number]: Maximum number of vertical pixels for the logo
	layer

    - xlnx,logo-width [number]: Maximum number of horizontal pixels for the logo
	layer


    Optional Properties:
    - xlnx,logo-transp: Logo support color key transparency feature (note:
	not supported at this time)

    - xlnx,logo-pixel-alpha: Logo supports per pixel alpha data (e.g. RGBA).


Additional Nodes Requiring Modificaton

There must exist a drm node in the dts which much be updated as follows
(see xilinx_drm.txt for more information about the composition of the DRM
driver node in the device tree):

    Additional Required Properties for xilinx_drm Node:

    - xlnx,mixer: Phandle reference to mixer IP node

    - xlnx,mixer-reset-gpios: Should include a phandle reference to
	the gpio controller with the proper gpio id and level (mixer reset
	default should be set to "low")


    Required Properties for each drm plane# Node:

    Each plane node served by a mixer layer should include the
    the following property:

    - xlnx,mixer-layer: A phandle reference to the mixer layer node serving
	this plane.


Example:

This sample is of a mixer IP core that has two overlay layers enabled in
addition to the logo layer.  The mixer's layer_0 is configured to expect "RGB"
on the media bus.  The DMA device streaming to layer_0 is capable of delivering
RGB data on the bus provided memory is formated as RBG type data.  As such,
we've chosen "bgr888" as our intended memory format for layer_0.
Overlay 1 is a streaming video input layer which is served by a separate dma
IP core. Overlay 2 is memory-based (i.e. dma-driven) layer (no need for a
separate dma IP core). Additionally, the mixer's reset line is on gpio #79
as indicated in the xilinx_drm node.  This Mixer-based design is configured
for 8 bits per component and one pixel per clock.
