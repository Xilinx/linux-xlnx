Binding for Xylon configurable video controller logiCVC IP core

Required properties:
 - compatible: value must be "xylon,logicvc-4.00.a"
 - reg: MMIO base address and size of the logiCVC IP core address space
 - interrupts-parent: the phandle for interrupt controller
 - interrupts: the interrupt number
 - colorspace: video output colorspace
      (0=RGB, 1=YUV 4:2:2, 2=YUV 4:4:4)
 - interface: video output interface
      (0=Parallel, 1=ITU656)
 - pixel-stride: layer width in pixels
      Common for all available logiCVC standard layers.

 - layer_N: layer has its own configuration described with below properties,
      where N is layer ID in range 0 - 4
   - bits-per-pixel: layer bits per pixel configuration (16, 32)
         Layer is configured to be used with specific pixel width in bits.
         Pixels written to layer video memory must match in size to configured
         bits per pixel value.
   - format: layer format (0=RGB, 1=YUV)
         Layer is configured to be used with specific color format.
         Pixels written to layer video memory must match specified color format.
   - transparency: layer transparency (0=Layer, 1=Pixel)
         logiCVC layer can be configured to have transparency control on
         layer or pixel level.
         "Layer" mode enables controlling of layer transparency by changing
         alpha value in single logiCVC register.
         "Pixel" mode enables controlling of pixel transparency by changing
         dedicated alpha bits of specific pixel in video memory.

Optional properties:
 - background-layer-bits-per-pixel: background layer bits per pixel (16, 32)
      If omitted, last available layer is logiCVC standard layer, which has its
      own video memory of specific size, color format and specified
      bits per pixel.
      If 16 or 32, last available layer is logiCVC background layer,
      with only specified bits per pixel value.
 - is-readable-regs: all logiCVC registers are available for reading
      If omitted, only Interrupt Status, Power Control and IP Version registers
      are available for reading.
 - is-size-position: logiCVC functionality for controlling on screen layer size
      and position is available
      If omitted, functionality is not available.
 - address: layer video memory address for layer_N where N is layer ID in
      range 0 - 4
      logiCVC can be configured to have layer video memory address hardcoded
      as layer register reset value. This video memory is not part of the system
      memory nor visible from the system. Still it is accessible by CPU and hw
      devices.
      If omitted, layer video memory address is set dynamically by
      device driver.

Example:

	logicvc_0: logicvc@40000000 {
		compatible = "xylon,logicvc-4.00.a";
		reg = <0x40000000 0x6000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic_0>;
		interrupts = <0 59 4>;
		background-layer-bits-per-pixel = <32>;
		colorspace = <1>;
		interface = <0>;
		is-readable-regs;
		is-size-position;
		pixel-stride = <2048>;
		layer_0 {
			address = <0x30000000>;
			bits-per-pixel = <16>;
			format = <0>;
			transparency = <0>;
		};
		layer_1 {
			address = <0x30500000>;
			bits-per-pixel = <32>;
			format = <0>;
			transparency = <0>;
		};
		layer_2 {
			address = <0x30E00000>;
			bits-per-pixel = <32>;
			format = <0>;
			transparency = <1>;
		};
		layer_3 {
			address = <0x31700000>;
			bits-per-pixel = <16>;
			format = <1>;
			transparency = <0>;
		};
	};
