Broadcom Kona Family CPU Enable Method
--------------------------------------
This binding defines the enable method used for starting secondary
CPUs in the following Broadcom SoCs:
  BCM23550

The enable method is specified by defining the following required
properties in the "cpu" device tree node:
  - enable-method = "brcm,bcm23550";
  - secondary-boot-reg = <...>;

The secondary-boot-reg property is a u32 value that specifies the
physical address of the register used to request the ROM holding pen
code release a secondary CPU.  The value written to the register is
formed by encoding the target CPU id into the low bits of the
physical start address it should jump to.

Example:
	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		cpu0: cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
			reg = <0>;
		};

		cpu1: cpu@1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "arm,cortex-a9";
			reg = <1>;
			enable-method = "brcm,bcm23550";
			secondary-boot-reg = <0x3500417c>;
		};
	};
