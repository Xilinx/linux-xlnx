QCOM device tree bindings
-------------------------

Some qcom based bootloaders identify the dtb blob based on a set of
device properties like SoC and platform and revisions of those components.
To support this scheme, we encode this information into the board compatible
string.

Each board must specify a top-level board compatible string with the following
format:

	compatible = "qcom,<SoC>[-<soc_version>][-<foundry_id>]-<board>[/<subtype>][-<board_version>]"

The 'SoC' and 'board' elements are required. All other elements are optional.

The 'SoC' element must be one of the following strings:

	apq8016
	apq8074
	apq8084
	apq8096
	msm8916
	msm8974
	msm8996

The 'board' element must be one of the following strings:

	cdp
	liquid
	dragonboard
	mtp
	sbc

The 'soc_version' and 'board_version' elements take the form of v<Major>.<Minor>
where the minor number may be omitted when it's zero, i.e.  v1.0 is the same
as v1. If all versions of the 'board_version' elements match, then a
wildcard '*' should be used, e.g. 'v*'.

The 'foundry_id' and 'subtype' elements are one or more digits from 0 to 9.

Examples:

	"qcom,msm8916-v1-cdp-pm8916-v2.1"

A CDP board with an msm8916 SoC, version 1 paired with a pm8916 PMIC of version
2.1.

	"qcom,apq8074-v2.0-2-dragonboard/1-v0.1"

A dragonboard board v0.1 of subtype 1 with an apq8074 SoC version 2, made in
foundry 2.
