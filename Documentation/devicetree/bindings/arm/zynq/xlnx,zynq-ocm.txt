Device tree bindings for Zynq's OCM

The OCM is divided to 4 64kB segments which can be separately configured
to low or high location. Location is controlled via SLCR.

Required properties:
 compatible: Compatibility string. Must be "xlnx,zynq-ocm-1.0".
 reg: Specify the base and size of the OCM registers in the memory map.
      E.g.: reg = <0xf800c000 0x1000>;

Example:
ocmc: ocmc@f800c000 {
	compatible = "xlnx,zynq-ocm-1.0";
	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <0 3 4>;
	reg = <0xf800c000 0x1000>;
} ;
