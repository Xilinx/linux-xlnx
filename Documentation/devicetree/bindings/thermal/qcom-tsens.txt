* QCOM SoC Temperature Sensor (TSENS)

Required properties:
- compatible :
 - "qcom,msm8916-tsens" : For 8916 Family of SoCs
 - "qcom,msm8974-tsens" : For 8974 Family of SoCs
 - "qcom,msm8996-tsens" : For 8996 Family of SoCs

- reg: Address range of the thermal registers
- #thermal-sensor-cells : Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description.
- Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt to know how to specify
nvmem cells

Example:
tsens: thermal-sensor@900000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8916-tsens";
		reg = <0x4a8000 0x2000>;
		nvmem-cells = <&tsens_caldata>, <&tsens_calsel>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "caldata", "calsel";
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
	};
