Xilinx VPHY (Staging)

The Xilinx Video PHY is a high-level video-specific wrapper around
different versions of the GT PHY. Its driver is phy/phy-xilinx-vphy.c

It offers the PHY driver interface as well as higher-level video
specific support functions.

Its current users are Xilinx HDMI RX/TX SS.
(See xlnx,v-hdmi-rx-ss.txt and xlnx,v-hdmi-tx-ss.txt)


Required Properties:
 - compatible: Should be "xlnx,vid-phy-controller-2.0".
 - reg: Base address and size of the IP core.
 - interrupts: Interrupt number.
 - interrupts-parent: phandle for interrupt controller.
 
 - clocks: phandle for axi-lite clock and dru clock
 - clock-names: The identification string, "axi-lite", is always required
          and "dru-clk" is required for NI DRU clock for phy
		  
 - phys: phandle for phy lanes registered for hdmi protocol. HDMI always 
         require 3 lanes
 - phy-names: The identification string, "hdmi-phy0" and so on

 - xlnx,input-pixels-per-clock: IP configuration for samples/clk (1, 2, 4)
         Note: Only 2 is supported at this time

 - xlnx,nidru: flag to indicate if DRU is present
 - xlnx,nidru-refclk-sel: DRU clock selector
 - xlnx,rx-no-of-channels: Required Rx channels for registered protocol
 - xlnx,rx-pll-selection: Rx pll selector
 - xlnx,rx-protocol: 1=HDMI, 0=DP (Note: Only HDMI is supported at this time)
 - xlnx,rx-refclk-sel: Reference Rx clock selector
 - xlnx,tx-no-of-channels: Required Rx channels for registered protocol
 - xlnx,tx-pll-selection = Tx pll selector
 - xlnx,tx-protocol: 1=HDMI, 0=DP (Note: Only HDMI is supported at this time)
 - xlnx,tx-refclk-sel: Reference Rx clock selector
 - xlnx,hdmi-fast-switch: Flag to indicate fast switching logic availability
 - xlnx,transceiver-type: GT type. Must be set per GT device used
 - xlnx,tx-buffer-bypass: Flag to indicate buffer bypass logic availability
 - xlnx,transceiver-width: Defines 4 Byte or 2 Byte mode
                      (Note: Only 4 byte is supported at this time) 

 - lane<n>: (port (child) nodes)
	lane0:
		- #phy-cells	: Should be 4
			Cell after port phandle is device type from:
			- <controller_type controller_instance is_shared direction_tx>

			controller_type = 0 for HDMI
            controller_instance = [0, ...] indexes the instance of the protocol
                                  controller	
            is_shared = 1 if the RX and TX can be shared across the same 
			            protocol/controller
            direction_tx = 0 for RX and 1 for TX

(These properties are intended for future steering of multiple protocols 
sharing VPHYs, and are therefore subject to change.)

An example is, with comments for work-in-progress (TODO):
