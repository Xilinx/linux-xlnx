* ARM SP805 Watchdog Timer (WDT) Controller

SP805 WDT is a ARM Primecell Peripheral and has a standard-id register that
can be used to identify the peripheral type, vendor, and revision.
This value can be used for driver matching.

As SP805 WDT is a primecell IP, it follows the base bindings specified in
'arm/primecell.txt'

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "arm,sp805-wdt", "arm,primecell"
- reg : Base address and size of the watchdog timer registers.
- clocks : From common clock binding.
           First clock is PCLK and the second is WDOGCLK.
           WDOGCLK can be equal to or be a sub-multiple of the PCLK frequency.
- clock-names : From common clock binding.
                Shall be "apb_pclk" for first clock and "wdog_clk" for the
                second one.

Optional properties:
- interrupts : Should specify WDT interrupt number.

Examples:

		cluster1_core0_watchdog: wdt@c000000 {
			compatible = "arm,sp805-wdt", "arm,primecell";
			reg = <0x0 0xc000000 0x0 0x1000>;
			clocks = <&clockgen 4 3>, <&clockgen 4 3>;
			clock-names = "apb_pclk", "wdog_clk";
		};
