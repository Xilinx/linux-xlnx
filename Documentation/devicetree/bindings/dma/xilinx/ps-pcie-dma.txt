* Xilinx PS PCIe Root DMA

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "xlnx,ps_pcie_dma-1.00.a"
- reg: Register offset for Root DMA channels
- reg-names: Name for the register. Should be "ps_pcie_regbase"
- interrupts: Interrupt pin for Root DMA
- interrupt-names: Name for the interrupt. Should be "ps_pcie_rootdma_intr"
- interrupt-parent: Should be gic in case of zynqmp
- rootdma: Indicates this platform device is root dma.
	This is required as the same platform driver will be invoked by pcie end points too
- dma_vendorid: 16 bit PCIe device vendor id.
	This can be later used by dma client for matching while using dma_request_channel
- dma_deviceid: 16 bit PCIe device id
	This can be later used by dma client for matching while using dma_request_channel
- numchannels: Indicates number of channels to be enabled for the device.
	Valid values are from 1 to 4 for zynqmp
- ps_pcie_channel : One for each channel to be enabled.
	This array contains channel specific properties.
	Index 0: Direction of channel
		Direction of channel can be either PCIe Memory to AXI memory i.e., Host to Card or
		AXI Memory to PCIe memory i.e., Card to Host
		PCIe to AXI Channel Direction is represented as 0x1
		AXI to PCIe Channel Direction is represented as 0x0
	Index 1: Number of Buffer Descriptors
		This number describes number of buffer descriptors to be allocated for a channel
	Index 2: Number of Queues
		Each Channel has four DMA Buffer Descriptor Queues.
		By default All four Queues will be managed by Root DMA driver.
		User may choose to have only two queues either Source and it's Status Queue or
			Destination and it's Status Queue to be handled by Driver.
		The other two queues need to be handled by user logic which will not be part of this driver.
		All Queues on Host is represented by 0x4
		Two Queues on Host is represented by 0x2
	Index 3: Coalesce Count
		This number indicates the number of transfers after which interrupt needs to
		be raised for the particular channel. The allowed range is from 0 to 255
	Index 4: Coalesce Count Timer frequency
		This property is used to control the frequency of poll timer. Poll timer is
		created for a channel whenever coalesce count value (>= 1) is programmed for the particular
		channel. This timer is helpful in draining out completed transactions even though interrupt is
		not generated.

Client Usage:
	DMA clients can request for these channels using dma_request_channel API
