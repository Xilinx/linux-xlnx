The Xilinx framebuffer DMA engine supports two soft IP blocks.  One IP
block is used for reading frame data from memory (FB Read) to the device 
and the other IP block is used for writing frame data from the device 
to memory (FB Write).  Both the FB Read/Write IP blocks are aware of the
format of the data being written to or read from memory including RGB and 
YUV in packed, planar, and semi-planar formats.  Because the FB Read/Write
is format aware, only one buffer pointer is needed by the IP blocks even
when planar or semi-planar format are used.

FB Read Required properties:
- #dma-cells        : should be 1
- compatible		: Should be "xlnx,axi-frmbuf-rd-1.00.a"
- interrupt-parent	: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through.
- interrupts		: Should contain DMA channel interrupt.
- reset-gpios       : Should contain GPIO reset phandle.
- reg			    : Memory map for module access.
- xlnx,vid-format	: Format of the frame buffer data to read.  Possible
                      values include:
                    "xlx1" = RGBX8 (RGB)
                    "xlx2" = YUVX8 (4:4:4)
                    "yuyv" = YUYV8 (4:2:2)
                    "nv16" = Y_UV8 (4:2:2 semi-planar)
                    "nv12" = Y_UV8_420 (4:2:0 semi-planar)
                    "rgb3" = RGB8 (RGB)
                    "grey" = YUV8 (YUV) 
                    "xlx3" = Y8 (YUV)

Optional properties:
- None
