The Xilinx framebuffer DMA engine supports two soft IP blocks: one IP
block is used for reading video frame data from memory (FB Read) to the device
and the other IP block is used for writing video frame data from the device
to memory (FB Write).  Both the FB Read/Write IP blocks are aware of the
format of the data being written to or read from memory including RGB and
YUV in packed, planar, and semi-planar formats.  Because the FB Read/Write
is format aware, only one buffer pointer is needed by the IP blocks even
when planar or semi-planar format are used.

FB Read Required propertie(s):
- compatible		: Should be "xlnx,axi-frmbuf-rd-v2"

Note: Compatible string "xlnx,axi-frmbuf-rd" and the hardware it
represented is no longer supported.

FB Write Required propertie(s):
- compatible		: Should be "xlnx,axi-frmbuf-wr-v2"

Note: Compatible string "xlnx,axi-frmbuf-wr" and the hardware it
represented is no longer supported.

Required Properties Common to both FB Read and FB Write:
- #dma-cells		: should be 1
- interrupt-parent	: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
- interrupts		: Should contain DMA channel interrupt
- reset-gpios		: Should contain GPIO reset phandle
- reg			: Memory map for module access
- xlnx,dma-addr-width	: Size of dma address pointer in IP (either 32 or 64)

Examples

FB Read Example:
++++++++
v_frmbuf_rd_0: v_frmbuf_rd@80000000 {
	#dma-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "xlnx,axi-frmbuf-rd-v2";
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 92 4>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio 80 1>;
	reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x10000>;
	xlnx,dma-addr-width = <32>;
};

FB Write Example:
++++++++
v_frmbuf_wr_0: v_frmbuf_wr@80000000 {
	#dma-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "xlnx,axi-frmbuf-wr-v2";
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <0 92 4>;
	reset-gpios = <&gpio 80 1>;
	reg = <0x0 0x80000000 0x0 0x10000>;
	xlnx,dma-addr-width = <64>;
};
