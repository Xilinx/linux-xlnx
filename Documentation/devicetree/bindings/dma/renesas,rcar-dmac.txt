* Renesas R-Car (RZ/G) DMA Controller Device Tree bindings

Renesas R-Car Generation 2 SoCs have multiple multi-channel DMA
controller instances named DMAC capable of serving multiple clients. Channels
can be dedicated to specific clients or shared between a large number of
clients.

Each DMA client is connected to one dedicated port of the DMAC, identified by
an 8-bit port number called the MID/RID. A DMA controller can thus serve up to
256 clients in total. When the number of hardware channels is lower than the
number of clients to be served, channels must be shared between multiple DMA
clients. The association of DMA clients to DMAC channels is fully dynamic and
not described in these device tree bindings.

Required Properties:

- compatible: "renesas,dmac-<soctype>", "renesas,rcar-dmac" as fallback.
	      Examples with soctypes are:
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7743" (RZ/G1M)
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7745" (RZ/G1E)
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7790" (R-Car H2)
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7791" (R-Car M2-W)
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7792" (R-Car V2H)
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7793" (R-Car M2-N)
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7794" (R-Car E2)
		- "renesas,dmac-r8a7795" (R-Car H3)

- reg: base address and length of the registers block for the DMAC

- interrupts: interrupt specifiers for the DMAC, one for each entry in
  interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names: one entry per channel, named "ch%u", where %u is the
  channel number ranging from zero to the number of channels minus one.

- clock-names: "fck" for the functional clock
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: must contain "fck" for the functional clock.

- #dma-cells: must be <1>, the cell specifies the MID/RID of the DMAC port
  connected to the DMA client
- dma-channels: number of DMA channels
