DT bindings for the Renesas Advanced Power Management Unit

Renesas R-Car line of SoCs utilize one or more APMU hardware units
for CPU core power domain control including SMP boot and CPU Hotplug.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "renesas,<soctype>-apmu", "renesas,apmu" as fallback.
	      Examples with soctypes are:
		- "renesas,r8a7790-apmu" (R-Car H2)
		- "renesas,r8a7791-apmu" (R-Car M2-W)
		- "renesas,r8a7792-apmu" (R-Car V2H)
		- "renesas,r8a7793-apmu" (R-Car M2-N)
		- "renesas,r8a7794-apmu" (R-Car E2)

- reg: Base address and length of the I/O registers used by the APMU.

- cpus: This node contains a list of CPU cores, which should match the order
  of CPU cores used by the WUPCR and PSTR registers in the Advanced Power
  Management Unit section of the device's datasheet.


Example:

This shows the r8a7791 APMU that can control CPU0 and CPU1.

	apmu@e6152000 {
		compatible = "renesas,r8a7791-apmu", "renesas,apmu";
		reg = <0 0xe6152000 0 0x188>;
		cpus = <&cpu0 &cpu1>;
	};
