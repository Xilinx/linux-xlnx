description: |+
  The Xilinx AI Engine is a tile processor with many cores (up to 400) that
  can run in parallel. The data routing between cores is configured through
  internal switches, and shim tiles interface with external interconnect, such
  as memory or PL. One AI engine device can have multiple apertures, each
  has its own address space and interrupt. At runtime application can create
  multiple partitions within an aperture which are groups of columns of AI
  engine tiles. Each AI engine partition is the minimum resetable unit for an
  AI engine application.

  '#address-cells':
    enum: [2]
    description: |
      size of cell to describe AI engine range of tiles address.
      It is the location of the starting tile of the range.
      As the AI engine tiles are 2D array, the location of a tile
      is presented as (column, row), the address cell is 2.

  '#size-cells':
    enum: [2]
    description: |
      size of cell to describe AI engine range of tiles size.
      As the AI engine tiles are 2D array, the size cell is 2.

      platform design tools.
      AI engine partition driver will create a FPGA bridge when probes the
      AI engine partition. The AI engine SHIM row of the partition is the
      bridge to connect AI engine partition, FPGA and PS.

          It describes the group of tiles of the AI engine partition. It needs
          to include the SHIM row. The format is defined by the parent AI engine
          device node's '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' properties. e.g. a v1
          AI engine device has 2D tiles array, the first row is SHIM row. A
          partition which has 50 columns and 8 rows of core tiles and 1 row of
