LogicoreIP designed compatible with Xilinx ZYNQ family.
-------------------------------------------------------

General concept
---------------

LogicoreIP design to provide the isolation between processing system
and programmable logic. Also provides the list of register set to configure
the frequency.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of:
	"xlnx,vcu"
	"xlnx,vcu-logicoreip-1.0"
- reg, reg-names: There are two sets of registers need to provide.
	1. vcu slcr
	2. Logicore
	reg-names should contain name for the each register sequence.
- #clock-cells : Must be 1
- clocks: phandle for aclk, pll_ref and encoder/decoder clocksources
- clock-names: The identification string,
	* "aclk", is always required for the axi clock.
	* "pll_ref" is required for pll.
	* "vcu_core_enc" is required for VCU core encoder.
	* "vcu_core_dec" is required for VCU core decoder.
	* "vcu_mcu_enc" is required for MCU core encoder.
	* "vcu_mcu_dec" is required for MCU core decoder.
- ranges
- VCU Init driver node define the following child nodes:
	* Allegro encoder driver node
		- compatible: Must be "al,al5e"
		- reg: There is a one set of register.
		- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
		- interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller
		  that services interrupts for this device.
	* Allegro decoder driver node
		- compatible: Must be "al,al5d"
		- reg: There is a one set of register.
		- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
		- interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller
		  that services interrupts for this device.

Optional properties:
- reset-gpios : The GPIO used to reset the VCU, if available. Need use this
		reset gpio when in design 'vcu_resetn' is driven by gpio. See
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt for details.

Example:

	xlnx_vcu: vcu@a0040000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,vcu-logicoreip-1.0";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		reg = <0x0 0xa0040000 0x0 0x1000>,
			 <0x0 0xa0041000 0x0 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "vcu_slcr", "logicore";
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 0x4e GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		#clock-cells = <0x1>;
		clock-names = "pll_ref", "aclk", "vcu_core_enc", "vcu_core_dec", "vcu_mcu_enc", "vcu_mcu_dec";
		clocks = <&si570_1>, <&clkc 71>, <&xlnx_vcu 1>, <&xlnx_vcu 2>, <&xlnx_vcu 3>, <&xlnx_vcu 4>;
		ranges;
		encoder: al5e@a0000000 {
			compatible = "al,al5e";
			reg = <0x0 0xa0000000 0x0 0x10000>;
			interrupts = <0 89 4>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		};

		decoder: al5d@a0020000 {
			compatible = "al,al5d";
			reg = <0x0 0xa0020000 0x0 0x10000>;
			interrupts = <0 89 4>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		};
	};
