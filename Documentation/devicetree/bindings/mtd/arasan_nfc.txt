Arasan Nand Flash Controller with ONFI 3.1 support

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arasan,nfc-v3p10"
- reg: Memory map for module access
- interrupt-parent: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt for the device
- clock-name: List of input clocks - "clk_sys", "clk_flash"
	      (See clock bindings for details)
- clocks: Clock phandles (see clock bindings for details)

Optional properties:
- arasan,has-mdma: Enables Dma support
- num-cs: Number of chip selects used

for nand partition information please refer the below file
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/partition.txt

Example:
	nand0: nand@ff100000 {
		compatible = "arasan,nfc-v3p10"
		reg = <0x0 0xff100000 0x1000>;
		clock-name = "clk_sys", "clk_flash"
		clocks = <&misc_clk &misc_clk>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 14 4>;
		arasan,has-mdma;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>

		nand@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			partition@0 {
				label = "filesystem";
				reg = <0x0 0x0 0x400000>;
                        };
			(...)
		};
