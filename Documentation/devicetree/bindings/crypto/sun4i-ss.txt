Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "allwinner,sun4i-a10-crypto".
- reg: Should contain the Security System register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the Security System.
- clocks : List of clock specifiers, corresponding to ahb and ss.
- clock-names : Name of the functional clock, should be

	* "mod" : SS controller clock

Optional properties:
 - resets : phandle + reset specifier pair
 - reset-names : must contain "ahb"

Example:
	crypto: crypto-engine@01c15000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-crypto";
		reg = <0x01c15000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 86 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&ahb_gates 5>, <&ss_clk>;
		clock-names = "ahb", "mod";
	};
