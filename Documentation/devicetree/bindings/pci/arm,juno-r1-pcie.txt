* ARM Juno R1 PCIe interface

This PCIe host controller is based on PLDA XpressRICH3-AXI IP
and thus inherits all the common properties defined in plda,xpressrich3-axi.txt
as well as the base properties defined in host-generic-pci.txt.

Required properties:
 - compatible: "arm,juno-r1-pcie"
 - dma-coherent: The host controller bridges the AXI transactions into PCIe bus
   in a manner that makes the DMA operations to appear coherent to the CPUs.
