* ThunderX PCI host controller for pass-1.x silicon

Firmware-initialized PCI host controller to on-chip devices found on
some Cavium ThunderX processors.  These devices have ECAM-based config
access, but the BARs are all at fixed addresses.  We handle the fixed
addresses by synthesizing Enhanced Allocation (EA) capabilities for
these devices.

The properties and their meanings are identical to those described in
host-generic-pci.txt except as listed below.

Properties of the host controller node that differ from
host-generic-pci.txt:

- compatible     : Must be "cavium,pci-host-thunder-ecam"

Example:

	pcie@84b000000000 {
		compatible = "cavium,pci-host-thunder-ecam";
		device_type = "pci";
		msi-parent = <&its>;
		msi-map = <0 &its 0x30000 0x10000>;
		bus-range = <0 31>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		#address-cells = <3>;
		#stream-id-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x84b0 0x00000000 0 0x02000000>;  /* Configuration space */
		ranges = <0x03000000 0x8180 0x00000000 0x8180 0x00000000 0x80 0x00000000>; /* mem ranges */
	};
