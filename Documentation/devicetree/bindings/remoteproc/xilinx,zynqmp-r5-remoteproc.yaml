title: Xilinx R5 remote processor controller

description:
  This document defines the binding for the remoteproc component that loads and
  boots firmwares on the Xilinx Zynqmp and Versal family chipsets.

  Note that the Linux has global addressing view of the R5-related memory (TCM)
  so the absolute address ranges are provided in TCM reg's.

      The R5F Sub-System device node should define one or two R5F child nodes,
      each node representing a Xilinx instantiation of the Arm Cortex R5F core.
      There should be one or two child nodes if the R5F is in Split mode and
      one child node if the R5F is in Lockstep mode.

      In Split mode each R5F core has two associated TCM Banks. R5_0 has
      TCM Banks 0A and 0B and R5_1 has TCM Banks 1A and 1B.

      In Lockstep mode only one R5F child node should be defined. This one
      child has access to TCM Banks 0A, 0B, 1A and 1B and any of the four can
      be included in the child R5F's sram property.

      This also supports arm-cortexr52 clusters on Versal-net platform with
      the same runtime modes.

      The example below shows Split mode with two child nodes.
