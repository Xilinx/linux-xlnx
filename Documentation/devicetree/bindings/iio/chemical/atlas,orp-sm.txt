Required properties:

  - compatible: must be "atlas,orp-sm"
  - reg: the I2C address of the sensor

  - interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt client
  node bindings.

Example:

atlas@66 {

	reg = <0x66>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <16 2>;
};
