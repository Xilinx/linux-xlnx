Required properties:

  - compatible: must be "atlas,ec-sm"
  - reg: the I2C address of the sensor
  - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  - interrupts: the sole interrupt generated by the device

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt client
  node bindings.

Example:

atlas@64 {
	compatible = "atlas,ec-sm";
	reg = <0x64>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <16 2>;
};
