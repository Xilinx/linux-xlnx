Required properties:

  - compatible: must be "avago,apds9960"
  - reg: the I2c address of the sensor
  - interrupt-parent: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  - interrupts : the sole interrupt generated by the device

  Refer to interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for generic interrupt client
  node bindings.

Example:

apds9960@39 {
	compatible = "avago,apds9960";
	reg = <0x39>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <16 1>;
};
