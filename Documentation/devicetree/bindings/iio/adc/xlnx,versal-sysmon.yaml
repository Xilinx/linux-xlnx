description: |
  Sysmon Driver uses Linux IIO framework which was used to abstract the supply
  voltages and temperatures across the chip as Voltage and Temperature
  Channels in the framework. Since there are only 160 supply voltage registers
  and 184 measurement points, there is no constant mapping of supply voltage
  registers and the measurement points. User has to select the voltages to
  monitor in design tool. Depending on the selection, a voltage supply gets
  mapped to one of the supply registers. So, this mapping information is
  provided to the driver via a device tree. Depending on the number of supplies
  enabled in the design, the device tree will contain the information of name
  of the supply enabled and the supply register it maps to.
