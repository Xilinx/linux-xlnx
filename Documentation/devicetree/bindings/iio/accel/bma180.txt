Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "bosch,bma180" or "bosch,bma250"
  - reg : the I2C address of the sensor

Optional properties:

  - interrupt-parent : should be the phandle for the interrupt controller

  - interrupts : interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ, it should by configured with
		flags IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH | IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
		For the bma250 the first interrupt listed must be the one
		connected to the INT1 pin, the second (optional) interrupt
		listed must be the one connected to the INT2 pin.

Example:

bma180@40 {
	compatible = "bosch,bma180";
	reg = <0x40>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio6>;
	interrupts = <18 (IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH | IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING)>;
};
