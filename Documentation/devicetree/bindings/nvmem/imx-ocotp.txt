Freescale i.MX6 On-Chip OTP Controller (OCOTP) device tree bindings

This binding represents the on-chip eFuse OTP controller found on
i.MX6Q/D, i.MX6DL/S, i.MX6SL, and i.MX6SX SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of
	"fsl,imx6q-ocotp" (i.MX6Q/D/DL/S),
	"fsl,imx6sl-ocotp" (i.MX6SL), or
	"fsl,imx6sx-ocotp" (i.MX6SX), followed by "syscon".
- reg: Should contain the register base and length.
- clocks: Should contain a phandle pointing to the gated peripheral clock.

Example:

	ocotp: ocotp@021bc000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6q-ocotp", "syscon";
		reg = <0x021bc000 0x4000>;
		clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_IIM>;
	};
