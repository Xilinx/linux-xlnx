= Amlogic eFuse device tree bindings =

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "amlogic,meson-gxbb-efuse"

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of eFuse, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	efuse: efuse {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxbb-efuse";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		sn: sn@14 {
			reg = <0x14 0x10>;
		};

		eth_mac: eth_mac@34 {
			reg = <0x34 0x10>;
		};

		bid: bid@46 {
			reg = <0x46 0x30>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

For example:

	eth_mac {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&eth_mac>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "eth_mac";
	};
