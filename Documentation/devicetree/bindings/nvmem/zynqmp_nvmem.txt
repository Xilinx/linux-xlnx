=  Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC nvmem firmware driver binding =

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "xlnx,zynqmp-nvmem-fw"

= Data cells =
Are child nodes of silicon id, bindings of which as described in
bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt

Example:

	nvmem_firmware {
		compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-nvmem-fw";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		 /* Data cells */
		soc_revision: soc_revision@0 {
			reg = <0x0 0x4>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

For example:

	pcap {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&soc_revision>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "soc_revision";
	};
