QCOM Secure Channel Manager (SCM)

Qualcomm processors include an interface to communicate to the secure firmware.
This interface allows for clients to request different types of actions.  These
can include CPU power up/down, HDCP requests, loading of firmware, and other
assorted actions.

Required properties:
- compatible: must contain one of the following:
 * "qcom,scm-apq8064" for APQ8064 platforms
 * "qcom,scm-msm8660" for MSM8660 platforms
 * "qcom,scm-msm8690" for MSM8690 platforms
 * "qcom,scm" for later processors (MSM8916, APQ8084, MSM8974, etc)
- clocks: One to three clocks may be required based on compatible.
 * Only core clock required for "qcom,scm-apq8064", "qcom,scm-msm8660", and "qcom,scm-msm8960"
 * Core, iface, and bus clocks required for "qcom,scm"
- clock-names: Must contain "core" for the core clock, "iface" for the interface
  clock and "bus" for the bus clock per the requirements of the compatible.

Example for MSM8916:

	firmware {
		scm {
			compatible = "qcom,scm";
			clocks = <&gcc GCC_CRYPTO_CLK> , <&gcc GCC_CRYPTO_AXI_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_CRYPTO_AHB_CLK>;
			clock-names = "core", "bus", "iface";
		};
	};
